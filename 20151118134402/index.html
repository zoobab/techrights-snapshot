							<p><em>Ensuring that rich people become even richer, resistant to challenge</em></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="buildings-nyc-740357-m.jpg" alt="NYC">
</p>
<p><em><b>Summary</b>: A look at some recent patent stories and what can be deduced from them, based on statistics and trends</em></p>
<p class="dropcap-first"><a name="top">T</a>HE <strong>HUGE</strong> news (in <em>our</em> assessment) that no Free software and GNU/Linux sites ever talk about is the fast demise of software patents in the United States. The prospects of patent blackmail are greatly affected (vastly diminished) by this. It helps any unaffiliated (independent from corporations and thus autonomous) software project compete against big entities with patents â those that have been shutting down Free software projects for years, usually by means of intimidation alone. Indie Free software developers cannot afford days in court and the income they receive from Free software they develop tends to be zero or very little, so the incentive to go to court is reasonably low.</p>
<p>Not only software patents are affected but patents on business methods are too. As <a nicetitle="Financial Services Patents Discussed at IPBC 2015" href="http://patentvue.com/2015/06/17/financial-services-patents-discussed-at-ipbc-2015/">this one article put it a fortnight ago</a>: âEach panelist had a very interesting perspective on the future of patents held by banking and financial services firms, where the majority of these patents are primarily business methods and software related.â</p>
<p>Debates about patent scope are important. Some wonder whether drugs should be patentable (ethical issues arise because of potentially mortal impact) and other <a nicetitle="That Medical Device Invention Can't Be Patentable â¦ Can It?" href="http://www.meddeviceonline.com/doc/that-medical-device-invention-can-t-be-patentable-can-it-0001">wonder about patenting medical devices</a> so as to price them out of reach, if not just monopolise them, thus making them more scarce (unavailable in poorer places or inaccessible to poor people).</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 200px;">âNo matter who wins and who loses a case, patent lawyers will always profit from it.â</span>Patents originally promised âprotectionâ for the little independent inventor, supposedly protecting him or her from much better funded corporations with copycats and mass production. In reality, as <a nicetitle="Independent Patent Claims" href="http://patentlyo.com/patent/2015/06/independent-patent-claims.html">these new figures</a> serve to show, patents are being hoarded or at least gathered mostly by large corporations, perhaps reminding us who is best served by todayâs patent system. Itâs getting worse â and fast! The past decade alone has been terrible amd the passage of power to large corporations accelerated, as evidenced by patents. As <em>Patently-O</em> puts it: âAs with dependent claims, the average number of independent claims per patent has also dropped significantly over the past decade. (From around 3.2 to 2.5 independent claims per patent).  As the histogram shows below, the decline comes primarily from a rise in the percentage of applications with three-or-fewer independent claims.â </p>
<p>Many thanks to Dennis Crouch for shattering a common myth about âprotectionâ for the little independent inventor. This myth is now dead. Crouch attributes this to costs and explains that âchange is largely driven by PTO fees and the ongoing commodification of patent prosecution.â</p>
<p>The system is now just tilted in favour of large corporations. The Fitbit-Jawbone feud which we <a nicetitle="Microsoft Has Chosen Patent Extortion and Patent Lawsuits Over Actual Products" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/20/microsoft-extortion-and-lawsuits/">mentioned the other day</a> is still in the news [<a nicetitle="Fitbit, Jawbone Rivalry Could Trigger A Patent-Suit Workout - Forbes" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2015/06/24/fitbit-jawbone-rivalry-could-trigger-a-patent-suit-workout/">1</a>, <a nicetitle="Fitbit and Jawbone Have Very Different Patent Strategies" href="http://patentvue.com/2015/06/24/fitbit-and-jawbone-have-very-different-patent-strategies/">2</a>] and it helps remind us who benefits the most from patent extravaganza (more so than corporations): patent lawyers. No matter who wins and who loses a case, patent lawyers will always profit from it. Patent litigation is a racket and a racket that needs to be ended, just like <a nicetitle="Smedley Darlington Butler" href="http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.html">Major General Smedley Butler once explained in relation to the war industry</a>. <a href="#top">â</a></p>

Some large businesses may genuinely like Battistelli, but not the citizens (of Europe) or the workers (of EPO); they are just afraid to say it. Itâs a reign of terror. Itâs tyranny.</p>

<h3>Situation of European Patent Office (EPO)</h3>
<h3>JUNE 2015</h3>
<p>Governments, politicians, representatives of Europeâs industry, NGOs and other interested critical observers, all should be concerned about the situation at the European Patent Office.</p>
<p>The officials of the EPO are entrusted with carrying out the European patent granting process, which includes taking responsibility for an independent review of European patent applications and for the application of law in this area of intellectual property.</p>
<p>However, governance over the current EPO procedure lacks fundamental checks and balances, there is no democratic control, and the staff themselves have in many cases no effective access to an independent, impartial judicial review when contesting a decision.</p>
<p>Yet checks and balances with access to a fair trial are fundamental components of the rule of law enjoyed in the democracies of our founding States, since they belong to their âcommunity of valuesâ. But apparently these are not applied in the EPO, which is fast becoming an island of lawlessness in the very heart of Europe.</p>
<p>For EPO staff, this governance problem is compounded by the now notoriously authoritarian administration style of the President of the EPO, Benoit Battistelli, such that the problem is now acute. Under his regime, the EPO has become a police state operating with impunity. Opposition is not tolerated and any staff perceived as being âobstructiveâ are removed by way of disciplinary procedures, penalties or other means, sometimes of dubious legality. Staff â in particular Union officials â are investigated and interrogated, in some cases by an external security agency, without any personal safeguards.</p>
<p>The events described in this document illustrate the dramatic downward trend in social dialog over the last four years. This drift, which is now increasingly visible to the public, finds its roots in an EPO management style characterized by its authoritarian leadership. The working climate is toxic for both individual staff in the EPO and for the broader functioning of this European institution as a whole. Functional immunity granted to the EPO has been conceived as blanket immunity, thereby exposing staff to the unlawful exertion of internal influence.</p>
<p>Not only the Administrative Council of the EPO, but also the European authorities and the public at large, all should beware the undesirable consequences when such abusive powers are left to operate effectively with total impunity.</p>

<h3>The EPO as a battlefield?<sup>1</sup></h3>
<p><b>1. Reforms</b></p>
<p>The European Patent Convention is now over 40 years old. The EPO is set up according to principles of the international civil service, many of which date back to the early 20th century. As early as 2007, the Administrative Council mandated a succession of EPO Presidents to develop and then introduce a number of reforms. The need for reform is understandable; it should strive to maintain the organisationâs compatibility with the needs and values of the public it professes to serve. However until now, most of the reforms have concerned human resources management and changing working conditions. None have addressed the issues of transparent governance with management accountability.<br>
The working conditions laid down in the Service Regulations are not published; once the Administrative Council adopts new working conditions, they are implemented without any possibility for an independent instance or for the public to verify their compatibility with fundamental rights or with the generally accepted principles of law. A combination of claimed total immunity and, at the behest of the President, the abolition of external audit has led to this grave situation. Far from being of simply academic concern, the issue of control over governance and enforcement of fundamental rights is a very concrete issue. Although EPO staff members are civil servants, they do not enjoy the same âsafety netâ as<br>
their counterparts in national administrations. In the event of termination of contract, EPO staff have no claim to support from a national health insurance, nor will they receive any unemployment benefits. In addition, their pension rights are not always secured.</p>
<p><b>2. Democratic deficit</b></p>
<p>All citizens of any democratic country retain, at least indirectly through their elected representatives, a certain degree of influence over the rules and legislation that will apply to them. They can always take part through internal procedures of political parties in the elaboration of proposals, they can participate in public debates, and ultimately they can vote legislators out of office at the next election. This is not the case in the EPO. Binding rules are enacted by the Administrative Council (which consists of non-elected civil servants from member states) on the recommendations of the President of the EPO. Lack of meaningful consultation or collaboration means staff has virtually no say and judicial control is limited.<br>
Many of the changes introduced are perceived as being nonsensical, disruptive and later deemed inconsistent with subsequent changes. This has caused widespread discontent.</p>
<p><b>3. Repression of dissent: An uncontrolled police state</b></p>
<p>Even though the outcome was often less than satisfactory, the EPO management must be given credit for trying, at least between 2007 and 2010, to allay the concerns of staff by engaging in meaningful dialogue with elected staff representatives, including the staff union. All this has changed dramatically under the current President. Instead of engaging in dialogue, he has chosen the path of systematically repressing the slightest expression of dissent and/or opposition.<br>
To silence any dissenting voice, the President has unilaterally introduced a raft of reforms including: changing the rules for challenging decisions; introducing new âinvestigation</p>

<p>guidelinesâ; introducing new strike rules; banning SUEPO from EPO premises; applying disciplinary measures to Staff Representatives; banning Staff Representatives from sending emails to more than 50 Staff members; investigating Staff representatives using the Investigating Unit who use sometimes dubious methods and external<sup>2</sup> contractors.<br>
Both the international press and the internet are replete with negative reports concerning the management style of BenoÃ®t Battistelli. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Censorship over deteriorating working conditions;</li>
<li>Disciplinary measures and threats against those individuals who raise the issue of four suicides in 3 years. Threats of reprisals against those who intend to join a peaceful demonstration duly authorized by the city authorities;</li>
<li>Suspension of and disciplinary measures against two Staff Committee nominees in the Appeal Committee, allegedly for daring to resist management manipulation;</li>
<li>Suspension of a âpatent judgeâ, a Board of Appeal member, by the EPO President under the guise of a âhouse banâ, which has now endured for more than 6 months)<sup>3</sup>;</li>
<li>Installation of secret spying equipment (including key-loggers) on computers in the semi-public areas of the EPO: such computers were made available to members of the Administrative Council (during AC meetings) and visiting patent attorneys while prosecuting patents for their clients;</li>
<li>Approval â albeit retroactively<sup>4</sup> â of such spying by the Data Protection Officer;</li>
<li>While ostensibly trying to repair its image by endeavouring to re-open dialogue with the Unions<sup>5</sup>, the Administration has concurrently launched investigations against the majority (if not all) of the Staff representatives and Union Officials. Many of these investigations have been sub-contracted to an external company, Control Risks, who have a somewhat<br>
controversial reputation. Their techniques involve interrogation without any safeguards, all this at the initiative of the investigation unit, itself under the direct authority of the President of the Office.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4. No effective access to justice</b></p>
<p>Staff is particularly aggrieved because it has no reasonable way to seek relief through judicial review:</p>
<ul>
<li>The internal dispute resolution process (the Internal Appeals Committee) and the subsequent external instance (the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation) are reserved for individual grievances that can be instigated once the alleged</li>
</ul>
<p>____________________<br>
<sup>2</sup> A comprehensive list can be found in the following SUEPO publication.<br>
<sup>3</sup> This action has generated enormous disquiet, not only among bloggers, attorneys and EPO union officials, but also within the Enlarged Board of Appeal. The Administrative Council endorsed this decision in its December session. Up to date (June 2015), disciplinary proceedings are on-going and the BoA member is still suspended until a further decision, probably the next AC session.<br>
<sup>4</sup> It has become apparent from a document (archive) available on internet (FOSS Patents) that the covert surveillance of publicly accessible computers in the Munich ISAR building by the Investigation Unit has been signed by the Data Protection Officer of the European Patent Office. A blogger, Florian Mueller, comments as follows: <em>âThere is now<br>
conclusive evidence that the EPO has violated basic human rights not only of its staff but even of unsuspecting visitors of one of the EPOâs Munich facilities. [...] [T]he request that the âdata protection officerâ (who is more than 25 years late to serve as a Stasi official) authorized merely refers to freedom-of-speech issues: âa sustained campaign of defamatory and insulting communications against [the EPO's Jack Warner] Vice President Zejlko Topic, other senior managers of the Office and possibly Administrative Council Delegates, in the form of normal post and electronic mail.â</em> In the mean time, neither the EPO nor the AC representatives have commented upon these events, let alone taken steps to suspend the investigations. See References [6]-[11] below.<br>
<sup>5</sup> In an attempt to limit the damage in the public eye, and to counter the criticism within the Administrative Council, the Chair of the Council Jesper Kongstad and the President of the EPO Benoit Battistelli called for âa renewed social dialogueâ: They â<em>consider in particular that the formal recognition of the trade unions within the EPOâs legal framework could create the conditions to re-launch the process and to overcome some longstanding issues<sup>5</sup>.â</em> This led the way to âtrilateral meetingsâ with representatives of the unions, of the Administrative Council and the President. However, it has become quite clear that any ârecognitionâ has to remain toothless.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>damage has occurred. Only in very exceptionally circumstances can a general decision, such as a decision modifying working conditions, be challenged perhaps collectively before it has been implemented.</li>
<li>An appeal against dismissal or other disciplinary action can only be sought in front of the âAdministrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisationâ (ILOAT) in Geneva, who cannot grant injunctive relief. The situation can only be corrected once the damage has occurred: such relief may take many years. This and the lack of any emergency procedure,<br>
makes EPO staff particularly vulnerable to succumbing to the threats inherent in the present management style.</li>
<li>The staff union has no access to either the Internal Appeals Committee or to the ATILO. As a corporate body established under national law, the Union may have access to the domestic courts of the host countries, but the EPO shields itself behind its functional immunity from any and all jurisdiction and execution.</li>
<li>Even when staff members have access to the statutory dispute resolution process, it takes on average 3-5 years for a grievance to be assessed by the Internal Appeals Committee. If the grievance then proceeds to the ATILO, the claimant can count on a minimum of another 3-4 years before the grievance is heard. All in all, with the current increasing backlog in the<br>
Internal Appeals Committee and at the ATILO, it is expected that grievances lodged after 2011 will not be adjudicated before at least a decade.</li>
<li>Staff repeatedly complain that the Appeals Committee is both highly dysfunctional and lacking in impartiality. Things were so bad that in October 2014, the Central Staff Committee refused to appoint representatives to the Appeals Committee until these issues were resolved. Instead of addressing them, the President simply ordered his appointees to proceed without staff representatives<sup>6</sup>.</li>
<li>On behalf of the AC, the Board of Auditors of the European Patent Organisation reviewed the Internal Appeals procedure in June 2015 (CA/20/15). They have confirmed that the President does not follow recommendations of his own Appeals Committee insofar as he  (almost) systematically rules against staff. The ILO-AT itself judged that it âis ill equipped to act as a trial courtâ (J.3291). For SUEPO, there can be no social peace without unrestricted access to impartial justice.</li>
<li>Moreover, if one takes the figures provided by the auditors for 2013 â 20 Nov 2014 in A/20/15 and compares them to the figures provided by the President in his social report (CA/55/15), one realizes that between 20 Nov. and 23 Dec. 2014, the Committee apparently managed to produce over 150 opinions in a single month! One could be tempted to conclude that when the clash exploded and the Appeals Committee was directed to continue its work without staff representatives, the remainder of the Committee either accelerated to an incredible speed or found a short-cut to the procedures: in a couple of sessions and within a few days, it took care and to provide opinions on the equivalent of the past yearâs âproductionâ.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>5. Conflict</b></p>
<p>The management style that currently prevails in the EPO may well be both detrimental to its proper functioning and undermine the EPOâs reputation on the international stage. This has generated a considerable number of articles in the mainstream press or well-respected blogs on intellectual property. Questions have even been raised in several European parliaments. Despite this unrest, the organization fails to adhere to European values.</p>
<p>To try and ease the situation, the staff representation has repeatedly proposed to Mr. Battistelli to use an external mediator; this suggestion has always been rejected. The Union has proposed a</p>

<p align="center">

</p>
<hr>
<p>framework agreement to regulate relations between itself and management; the proposal has also been ignored. Recently, the German court in Munich also suggested mediation as a means to<br>
facilitate resolution of a dispute with the union; Mr Battistelli flatly rejected the Courtâs recommendation.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Union has had to bring the matter before a national court where they claimed that the EPO was infringing SUEPOâs right to operate and to engage in collective bargaining. The Dutch Court of Appeal, in its February judgment, ruled in favour of SUEPO vs EPO. To quote from an article in the Nederlands Juristenblad, a Dutch legal magazine:</p>
<p><em>âThe Court of Appeal in The Hague has created an international precedent in the case against EPO by rejecting the immunity of an international organisation in a collective labour law case, and also awarding the claims on their merits, based on the fact that the organisation in question violated fundamental human rights. This decision is important because it further institutionalises the accountability of international organisations. Unfortunately the Netherlands also showed itself at its most narrow-minded: the Minister instructed the bailiff to not enforce the judgement because the organisation enjoys immunity from enforcement under international law. This instruction not only erodes the separation of powers stipulated by the Constitution, it isnât an obligation under international law either: as is the case for immunity from jurisdiction, immunity from enforcement can only be granted if the organisation adequately protects fundamental rights.â</em></p>
<p>In the meantime, the Dutch government has now apparently joined the EPO in an attempt to overturn the judgment in the next instance (âcassationâ)<sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p><b>6. An unhealthy concentration of Power.</b></p>
<p>Like many international organisations, the EPO and its (high) officials enjoy a degree of immunity that borders on impunity. There are virtually no checks and balances left to counter any abuse. Of perhaps greatest concern is the lack of checks and balances in respect of the highest âjudicial instanceâ of the EPO, the Board of Appeals. Even the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO took up this issue in early 2014 through a remarkable decision <sup>&gt;[16]</sup>.</p>
<p>President Battistelli has engaged in a series of reforms for the Boards of Appeal<sup>8</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Perceived independence</u>: a new proposal (CA/16/15) states its goals as âto increase the organisational and managerial autonomy of the BOA, the perception of their independence (enshrined in Article 23 EPC) and also their efficiency, in order to respect the principle of effective legal protection within the legal framework of the current EPCâ.<br>
In a position paper, the association of the members of the BoA (AMBA) criticised the proposal: in their opinion, it âmixes up the roles of a supervisory committee and a council of the judiciary without being eitherâ and without solving âthe problems noted in R 19/12â. Furthermore, âmaking re-appointment dependent on performance appraisals, including quality aspects, [goes] against the security of tenure.â uncertainty of permanent statusâ which in turn is not âhelpful in recruiting experienced external candidatesâ. Finally, the proposed âmove to Berlin would have serious consequences on manpowerâ.</li>
<li><u>New career proposal</u>: AMBA and the Presidium of the BoA equally criticised the new proposal for implementing a new career system noting that it âtakes no account of the special situation of the boards of appeal, and even removes existing derogationsâ.</li>
</ul>

<p>These proposals are under discussion and are receiving great public attention. AMBA concludes that these proposals are âin contrast to a clear separation of powers which is a basic principle in all European countries and which is of utmost importance for the acceptance of the European patent system.â</p>
<p><b>7. The interest of the European public</b></p>
<p>There is a serious problem of governance in the EPO. The opacity of its decision-making processes and the lack of accountability, which the EPO justifies on the basis of âits immunityâ, is anachronistic in both Europe and in the 21st century: we live in a time where states require from their institutions (and from each other) both financial transparency and accountability. While the EPO may still be âcompetitiveâ as an employer in terms of remuneration benefits, its internal human resources policies, in particular with regards to interpersonal relationships, are both antiquated and brutal.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, European society should not tolerate that some of its citizens are deprived of their fundamental rights <em>simply because they are employed by an intergovernmental organisation, or because they are well paid</em>. This is surely particularly pertinent when the EPO member states are, in their overwhelming majority, also member states of the European Union. Yet this is exactly what now happens at the EPO.</p>
<p>The Administrative Council of the EPO, and thereby vicariously the member states, are being at best complacent, at worst grossly negligent of their responsibilities. The Council largely gives the President <em>carte blanche</em>, without asking what the consequences might be or considering how he could use his powers. Structurally, the President of the EPO acts as accuser, investigator, judge and final arbiter on all matters; there is no separation of power guaranteeing a healthy system of checks and balances for his actions. The nearly absolute power the current President enjoys and the manner in which he uses it continues to be a source of particular concern and dismay. Staff and their unions consider the limitations on the freedom of expression and freedom of association (embodied in the strike regulations) without effective access to justice as breaches of their fundamental rights as Europeans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, beyond the fact that European citizens are deprived of the fundamental rights, this working environment is highly toxic for both the individual staff in the EPO and for the normal functioning of this European institution as a whole. An authoritarian leadership without effective judicial protection makes individual staff members particularly vulnerable to suffering under the present management style: not only does their health suffer, but their capacity as officials entrusted with the European patent granting process is impaired. Under these conditions, how can one expect EPO agents to fulfil their responsibilities and undertake an independent review of European patent applications and apply the law dictated by the EPC? If the EPO is tasked with granting patent rights to inventors and European industry, how credible are those rights if delivered by an institution that is ostensibly unable to comply with the rule of law in its own internal affairs?</p>
<p>Functional immunity granted to the EPO has been conceived by management as blanket immunity, thereby exposing staff to the use of abusive powers with total impunity.</p>
<p>It is high time that the competent authorities take a keener interest in what is happening at the EPO and insist that the house be put in order. This should be done by introducing proper policies through consultation and negotiation, not through repression and intimidation.</p>

<p>If âMister Presidentâ and âSun Kingâ (his common nickname), also known as BenoÃ®t Battistelli, ends up announcing his resignation (hopefully forced, albeit silently) some time soon, it wonât surprise us.

<p><em><b>Summary</b>: Naming and shaming those who are trying to reshape the consensus despite a rather consistent pattern of software patents being rejected</em></p>
<p class="dropcap-first"><a name="top">T</a>HE subject of software patents profoundly affects Free software, which is <a nicetitle="A Glance at Free/Libre Software Foes With Their Software Patents" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/17/patent-abusers/">still under attack from software patents</a>. The recent collapse of many software patents (not all) has been catalogued here for quite some time [<a nicetitle="Software Patents Continue Their Demise in The United States After Alice Ruling" href="http://techrights.org/2015/02/14/software-patents-ending/">1</a>, <a nicetitle="Yes, Software Patents Are Dying, But Media Continues to Be Dominated by Those Denying it For a Salary" href="http://techrights.org/2015/04/12/swpats-are-dying/">2</a>, <a nicetitle="Corporate Media Confirms the Demise of Software Patents in the United States; Will India and Europe Follow?" href="http://techrights.org/2014/10/14/decline-in-the-swpats-area/">3</a>, <a nicetitle="Demise of Software Patents and Refusal of the Patents âIndustryâ to Accept That" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/08/swpats-demise-and-denial/">4</a>, <a nicetitle="Patent Lawsuits Almost Halved After SCOTUS Ruling on âAbstractâ Software Patents" href="http://techrights.org/2014/10/13/lex-machina-numbers/">5</a>] and we continue to see more confirmatory evidence of this trend. The media which is run by or is at least influenced by patent practitioners does not like to cover this subject and itâs truly a shame that activists against software patents have gone so quiet in recent years. The patent lawyersâ press selects (or cherry-picks) cases that are exceptional and help reinforce software patents, even this month, leaving the public with the false impression that nothing has really changed after the <em>Alice</em> case. We oughtnât let this case go to waste.</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 200px;">âThatâs cherry-picking, but then again, that is what lawyers do, even when they cite precedence in court.â</span>Earlier this month we found some of the latest revisionism from lawyers. Proskauer Rose LLP pushed it by apparently paying (as a press release) for coverage, injecting a pro-software patents piece into lots of lawyersâ sites [<a nicetitle="Job applicant software patents not terminated for invalidity" href="http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=515aad99-2c18-40bb-92e9-56884bd726c3">1</a>, <a nicetitle="Job Applicant Software Patents Not Terminated for Invalidity" href="http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/job-applicant-software-patents-not-51041/">2</a>, <a nicetitle="Job Applicant Software Patents Not Terminated For Invalidity" href="http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/405826/Patent/Job+Applicant+Software+Patents+Not+Terminated+For+Invalidity">3</a>], including <em>The National Law Review</em>, which also went with the typical headline: <a nicetitle="Job Applicant Software Patents Not Terminated for Invalidity" href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/job-applicant-software-patents-not-terminated-invalidity">âJob Applicant Software Patents Not Terminated for Invalidityâ</a>. These are the publications that a lot of patent lawyers follow and the intent of Proskauer Rose LLP is probably to give them tips on how to game the system (which is basically what they all do, trying to bypass rules using common tricks). Here is a quote from the analysis: âAlthough the subject matter eligibility of software patents has come under increased scrutiny since the Supreme Court issued its opinion last year in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank, one Massachusetts court recently declined to invalidate a trio of patents directed to job applicant software. Plaintiff Kenexa had asserted infringement claims against three defendants, and two of the defendantsâincluding HireAbilityâsubsequently moved for judgment on the pleadings that Kenexaâs patents recite unpatentable subject matter under Â§ 101.â</p>
<p>So, they do acknowledge that âthe subject matter eligibility of software patents has come under increased scrutiny since the Supreme Court issued its opinion last year in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank,â but then they go on to just covering one exceptional case where software patents managed to survive in court. Thatâs cherry-picking, but then again, that is what lawyers do, even when they cite precedence in court. Itâs subjective by design. Thatâs just their job. The clients, and hence the lawyers, have an agenda to push. This is the transaction, but clients deserve an honest, objective advice. Itâs not journalism but more like advocacy (what the UK calls âbarristersâ are literally advocates). Just watch <a nicetitle="Creating a winning patent strategy from the ground up" href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/06/16/creating-a-winning-patent-strategy-from-the-ground-up/id=58772/">Mr. Quinn trying to sell his âservicesâ</a> while <a nicetitle="Chief Administrative Patent PTAB Judge Position Available" href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/06/16/chief-administrative-patent-ptab-judge-position-available/id=58705/">advertising for the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB)</a>. These people openly promote as broad a patent scope as possible (inclusive of software patents) for the same reasons arms and surveillance contractors want war and instability. The more problems the world has, the more business these people receive and the more money they make. Itâs the <a nicetitle="Broken windows theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows theory</a>. <a href="#top">â</a></p>

							<p><em><b>Summary</b>: Putting the PATENT Act aside for the time being, for it has little or no impact on the really problematic patents</em></p>
<p class="dropcap-first"><a name="top">W</a>hether one calls it Innovation/Invent/Invention/Awesome/BEST Act or just PATENT Act, the latest branding incarnation [<a nicetitle="PATENT Act Comes to US Senate, But Itâs Corporations-Leaning, Just Like Senate" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/09/patent-act-senate/">1</a>, <a nicetitle="Patent âReformâ Protecting American Talent and Entrepreneurship Act (PATENT) Act Hijacked by Mega-corporations" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/07/patent-act-review/">2</a>, <a nicetitle="The PATENT Act, Distraction of Trolls, and Lobbying for Software Patents by Protectionists" href="http://techrights.org/2015/05/19/lobbying-vs-scientists/">3</a>, <a nicetitle="Innovation Act/PATENT Act: No Reform (for People) to See Here, Move Along" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/17/no-reform-yet/">4</a>, <a nicetitle="Large Corporations Call the Shots in US Patent Reform" href="http://techrights.org/2015/05/25/large-corporations-call-the-shots-in-us-patent-reform/">5</a>, <a nicetitle="PATENT Act a âReformâ for Big Corporations, Hence Does Not Address the Core Issues, Including Patent Scope and Massive Patent Aggressors" href="http://techrights.org/2015/05/03/chuck-grassley-reform/">6</a>, <a nicetitle="The âInnovation Actâ is Not Patent Reform, Itâs Corporate Amendment Strengthening Patent Regime" href="http://techrights.org/2015/02/09/reform-and-frand/">7</a>] (whatever buzzword one chooses does not say anything about the substance), in practice there is very limited a reform. It has been systematically watered down, as some experts have already pointed out, to the point of being meaningful and beneficial only to few very large corporations with legions of lobbyists in Washington. Interestingly enough, it is completely absent from the news right now. Not that it matters so muchâ¦</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 200px;">âWe are likely to hear a lot about âreformâ and the so-called PATENT Act in the coming month (itâs not in the news, albeit still on the agenda), but nothing substantial will change as a result.â</span>An article by Mike Masnick <a nicetitle="The Free Market Case For Patent Reform" href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150624/16544431446/free-market-case-patent-reform.shtml">speaks of patent reform as it relates to so-called âfree marketsâ</a>. âA modest attempt at patent reform,â he wrote, â(mainly targeting egregious patent trolling practices) is making its way through Congress these days at the usual glacial pace. However, even if it does eventually make it through, there is still a tremendous amount left to do on patent reform. Derek Khanna, who famously wrote the wonderful House Republican Study Committee report urging major copyright reform â which so upset Hollywood that favors were called in to get the entire report retracted and cost Khanna his job, has now tried to write a similar report on patent reform. This one is for Lincoln Labs â a think tank trying to present more free market/libertarian ideas into the technology policy arena.â</p>
<p>We are likely to hear a lot about âreformâ and the so-called PATENT Act in the coming month (itâs not in the news, albeit still on the agenda), but nothing substantial will change as a result. In the coming few posts we will deal with the real reform that comes from key rulings at the courts, gradually weakening software patents. There is plenty of good news these days. <a href="#top">â</a></p>

Doc. 13836</p>
<p>25 June 2015</p>
<h3>Rollback of fundamental rights at the European Patent Office</h3>
<p><b>Written declaration No. 596</b></p>
<p>This written declaration commits only those who have signed it On 17 February 2015, the Hague Court of Appeal condemned the European Patent Office (EPO), arguing that its internal dispute settlement system led to a rollback of fundamental rights enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights and the European Social Charter. The Court considered that the EPO could not invoke its immunity when a trade union is deprived of any means to challenge violations of the personnelâs rights, for want of any legal remedy before the International Labour Organisation Administrative Tribunal or via any other internal procedure.</p>
<p>An international organisation cannot become a place of lesser law, sheltered by its jurisdictional immunity. Restraining the right of association, reducing the right to go on strike, preventing the personnel from being entitled to collective bargaining, depriving all organisations from any effective remedy and failing to carry out a court decision are all unacceptable developments. We call on the 38 member States of the EPO, all members of the Council of Europe, to bring this situation to an end and urge the EPOâs management to comply with the decision of the Hague Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>The latest item on <em>IP Kat</em> <a nicetitle="Council of Europe focuses on Eponia, and there's more to come" href="http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2015/06/council-of-europe-focuses-on-eponia-and.html">beat us to it</a>. Merpel writes: âAltogether more than 100 parliamentarians from 32 countries have now expressed their anxieties and concerns regarding the persistent erosion of fundamental rights experienced by EPO staff over the past year and a half at the hands of the current regime, which presumably still enjoys the substantial support of the Administrative Council which has notional control of the organisation.â</p>
<p>Merpel also found this <a nicetitle="Subject:  Attacks on workers' rights at the European Patent Office" href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2015-006026+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=en">political intervention</a> in the European Parliament:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2015-006026+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=en">
<p>The European Patent Office (EPO) was set up forty years ago. It currently employs about seven thousand highly qualified people, most of whom work at its offices in Germany (Munich) and the Netherlands (Ryswick). In 2014 alone, it received 274 000 patent applications from companies all over the world. Its budget of EUR 2 000 million makes it the second largest European institution after the Commission.</p>
<p>There have been a huge number of complaints about the EPO. Cases of staff suffering from depression (including four suicides since 2012), a climate of intimidation caused by the creation of an internal investigation unit, and restrictions on the right to strike have been reported by the trade union, SUEPO, which is now banned from EPO premises. Among other things, the union is complaining about managementâs plan to lower the cost of registering patents at the price of employeesâ health.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of this situation and what is being done to investigate it? Also, what are the grounds for the immunity granted to the European Patent Office, which allegedly derives from the fact that it is extraterritorial, thus making it impossible for any legal action to be taken to protect workersâ rights?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Over at <em>IP Kat</em> there are some interesting comments from what appears to be EPO staff. The first:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2015/06/council-of-europe-focuses-on-eponia-and.html">
<p>During this time in a Galaxy far away â¦.</p>
<p>The Administrative Council just extended for 3 years VP5 (Raimund Lutz) the man who finds everything perfectly legal (when national courts and parliamentaries donât)â¦</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>VP1 (who will be 70 at the end of his mandate whereas max. pension age at EPO is 67â¦.</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>Battistelli starts his new mandate with secret salarial conditions â¦</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>the AC did not bother to comment on the on-going spying on staff reps/unionists nor on public spying</p>
<p>All is fine in Eponia !!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second comment speaks of betrayal:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2015/06/council-of-europe-focuses-on-eponia-and.html">
<p>    Many years ago I gave a promise to the Office, and with it to the general public of Europe, that I would examine patents and only grant those with a high probability of validity as far as I could establish. In return for this the office made a promise to look after me. We had an agreement, which I considered to be binding. I have kept my promise so far and I intend to keep my promise. Unfortunately this is not made easier by the fact the some people in the Office have decided to withdraw the promise made by the office to me by changing the whole substance of my working conditions without my agreement. If I am to keep my promise, this must be tolerated, however, since there is no functioning legal system which will tell them to stop, so I have no defence. None the less, I intend to keep my promise, since I believe, and all the evidence Iâve seen confirms, that valid patents are important for the general public and the whole patent system.<br>
    It would be really nice if someone could persuade the office to revert to keeping itâs promise. I do hope these initiatives are a step along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many more anonymous comments in there. The management of the EPO seems to have become besieged by an increasingly informed workforce, Parliament, and public. This canât end well for Battistelli. His time is running out. <a href="#top">â</a></p>

							<p><em>Corporations now run the European Patent Office (EPO)</em></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="ray-of-light-311067-m.jpg" alt="Ray of light">
</p>
<p><em><b>Summary</b>: The shameful management of the EPO, which BenoÃ®t Battistelli constructed based on his nefarious self-serving agenda, keeps pushing forth in a direction that greatly harms European citizens while mistreating the EPOâs technical staff (scientists and examiners)</em></p>
<p><font size="5"><b><a name="top">T</a></b></font>HE <a nicetitle="EPO" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/EPO">EPO scandals</a> continue and there is no denying that there is trouble when <a nicetitle="An Estimated 1,000 EPO Staff in Munich Demonstrated Against EPO Management Yesterday Afternoon" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/25/epo-protest-over-corruption-and-abuses/">a huge proportion of the staff goes out to demonstrate right in front of the employer</a>. Only a shameless liar would try to blame some âdisgruntled employeeâ or âdefamationâ. The EPO, more so these days than ever before, is <em>not</em> a public service. It just sucks in public money. It is essentially a corporate entity masquerading as a public institution because it provides benefits like legal immunity, welfare (âtoo big to failâ), etc.</p>
<p>The EPO Administrative Council (AC), which has become BenoÃ®t Battistelliâs number one fan after some entryism, is <a nicetitle="Unitary Patent renewal fees agreed" href="http://www.managingip.com/Article/3465639/Managing-Patents-Archive/Unitary-Patent-renewal-fees-agreed.html">trying to destroy the European industry with more patent monopolies and fees</a>. According to patent lawyersâ media, Mr Kongstadâs office is at the forefront of this atrocious move:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.managingip.com/Article/3465639/Managing-Patents-Archive/Unitary-Patent-renewal-fees-agreed.html"><p>
The Select Committee of the EPO Administrative Council, which represents the 25 EU states expected to be covered by the Unitary Patent, adopted the so-called true top 4 proposal by a three-quarter majority yesterday.</p>
<p>One of the selling points of the planned Unitary Patent is that a single annual renewal fee payable to the EPO will maintain the right in the participating EU member states, meaning that national fees will no longer have to be paid.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The above says that the AC ârepresents the 25 EU statesâ, but in reality it seems to represent Battistelli and his rich friends, who want to become even richer.</p>
<p>The ACâs Kongstad is finding himself under fire again, this time from his own staff. SUEPOâs Web site says that âMs Bergot, Principal Director of Human Resources of the EPO, has scheduled new meetings of the working group on âunion recognitionâ between the administration and union officials. However, Mr Kongstad (Chairman of the Administrative Council) has still not reacted to the letter sent by SUEPO Central concerning the investigation of staff representatives and/or union executives during trilateral talks.</p>
<p>âPending Mr Kongstadâs written answer, as also reiteratered in the Council meeting of 24/25 June 2015, SUEPO regrets it must decline the invitation at present. Of course, SUEPO is looking forward to developments making the resumption of meaningful discussions possible.â</p>
<p>SUEPO has <a href="http://www.suepo.org/public/su15272cl.pdf">this PDF reply letter</a>, sent to Ms Bergot:</p>
<blockquote class="evidence"><p>
Dear Ms Bergot,</p>
<p>You have scheduled new meetings of the working group on âunions recognitionâ between the administration and union officials.</p>
<p>You must be aware of the letter sent by SUEPO Central to the Chairman of the Administrative Council, Mr Kongstad, which was made public on 10 June 2015 (*).</p>
<p>Pending Mr Kongstadâs written answer to our requests, as also reiteratered in the Council, we regret we must decline your invitation at present. Of course, we look forward to developments making the resumption of meaningful discussions possible.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Recall that <a href="http://techrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/inner-circle.pdf">Gilles Requena, the EPOâs Administrator (Presidential Office), is the spouse of Ms Bergot</a> <code>[PDF]</code>. Bergot, the Principal Director of Human Resources, is clearly there because of connections, not skills. Sheâs far from the only such instance. Battistelli has quickly turned the EPO into an international laughing stock. Itâs time to reclaim the EPO or reboot it. <a href="#top">â</a></p>

							<p><em><b>Summary</b>: Earliest coverage of yesterdayâs protest against EPO corruption and abuses</em></p>
<p class="dropcap-first"><a name="top">T</a>HE <a nicetitle="EPO" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/EPO">EPO</a> â <a nicetitle="Microsoft and the NSA" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/Microsoft_and_the_NSA">like Microsoft</a> â spies on people for business reasons, not for security reasons. Staff of the EPO decided to protest again, as <a nicetitle="EPO Protest in Munich and Growing Unpopularity of EPO Management, Media Manipulation by the Management" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/24/newspapers-manipulation/">we wrote</a> <a nicetitle="Demonstration Against European Patent Office Management in Munich This Wednesday" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/22/isar-building-protest/">earlier this week</a>, and <a nicetitle="Florian MÃ¼ller" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/Florian_M%C3%BCller">Microsoft Florian</a> was there to document it.</p>
<p>Florian MÃ¼ller, who used to lobby against software patents before defecting (Microsoft and other companies paid him for this), <a nicetitle="1,000 EPO employees took to the streets of Munich to protest hidden surveillance, other violations" href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2015/06/1000-epo-employees-took-to-streets-of.html">was there at the scene to cover the protest</a>. âYesterday,â he wrote early this morning, âthe Staff Union of the European Patent Office (SUEPO) held a demonstration in front of the EPOâs main building in Munich. While there have already been various other SUEPO demonstrations in Munich, a couple of which I reported on, yesterdayâs protest had a new (though not exclusive) focus: surveillance by means of hidden cameras and keyloggers. Participants in the demonstration carried signs showing surveillance camerasâ¦â</p>
<p>There is an estimate of the number of staff in attendance. âIt appears credible to me,â he said, that âapproximately 1,000 EPO employees participated â a fairly high percentage of all Munich-based EPO staff.â</p>
<p>There are some photos there to prove it (without peopleâs faces, obviously for their own protection, knowing BenoÃ®t Battistelliâs <em>modus operandi</em>).</p>
<p>Separately, the London-based patent lawyersâ blog <em>IP Kat</em> <a nicetitle="Consultation event on Court Fees for the Unified Patent Court - and news on timing of UK implementation" href="http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2015/06/consultation-event-on-court-fees-for.html">warns us</a> of the threat of UPC looming over the UK:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2015/06/consultation-event-on-court-fees-for.html"><p>
But first, a digression, which may be of more general interest than the specifics of the particular consultation.  The IPKat, ever eager to seek news for his dear readers, took the opportunity to ask whether there was any truth in the speculation that has appeared repeatedly in comments on this blog and elsewhere that the current UK Government might delay ratification of the UPC Agreement until after the UK Referendum on membership of the EU, which is not scheduled until 2017.  The Intellectual Property Office, as it turns out, has an answer prepared for this question, and the IPKat is delighted to share it with you.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The horrible UPC (making patents even worse and more wide-reaching) is trying to creep into Europe as quickly as possible (while the public is mostly asleep). The EPO is largely responsible for this and more scrutiny is needed. Itâs similar to those awful âtradeâ agreements, but awareness among the public is severely lacking. <a href="#top">â</a></p>

<p><em><b>Summary</b>: Poll shows that the European Patent Office (EPO) comes under fire for its media strategy which involves wasting taxpayersâ money on fake/organic media coverage that glorifies the EPO</em></p>
<p><font size="5"><b><a name="top">P</a></b></font>ROTESTS are said to have <a nicetitle="Demonstration Against European Patent Office Management in Munich This Wednesday" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/22/isar-building-protest/">just taken place in Munich</a>. <a nicetitle="EPO" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/EPO">EPO abuse</a> was the cause. Although there are no reports (yet) about the gathering, not even about the scale or number of people in attendance, it is the principle that counts. Maybe the protesters too should ape their managers and hire âmedia partnersâ such as <em>Les Echos</em>? Probably not. Only BenoÃ®t Battistelli would be desperate enough to do that.</p>
<p>We are meanwhile learning that patent lawyers in Europe, who are the target audience of <a nicetitle="Poll results: Inventor of the Year" href="http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/poll-results-inventor-of-year.html">this blog</a>, donât have a positive opinion of the EPO. As a recap:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/poll-results-inventor-of-year.html"><p>
 A few weeks ago, the IPKat asked whether the EPO ought to be organising and funding the European Inventor of the Year award. His concerns were twofold: the resources that are devoted to this event, and the fundamental question of whether the EPO ought to be seen to be ranking different inventions in terms of their merits.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, â43% (296 votes) were also unsupportive of the EPO involvement: âIt lies outside the powers and duties of the EPO.ââ</p>
<p>As we <a nicetitle="The EPO Still Wastes Public Money on Publicity Stunts and âReputation Managementâ Campaigns" href="http://techrights.org/2015/05/30/escaping-bad-publicity/">explained before</a>, this is misuse of public funds. The EPO <a nicetitle="The EPOâs Paid Propaganda Campaign in the Media" href="http://techrights.org/2015/02/01/epo-buys-coverage/">wastes public money on paid placements ('articles')</a> and <a nicetitle="French Newspaper Les Echos Censors Criticism of BenoÃ®t Battistelli and the EPO (Updated)" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/18/les-echos-epo-censorship/">'media partners', hoping to bury or pro-actively suppress any potentially negative publicity (even when it is very much deserved)</a>.</p>
<p>âThe IPKat wonders whether the EPO should now review its involvement with and funding of this event,â says the above blog post, âin the light of these concerns which appear to be shared by much of the IP community (or of this blogâs readership, at least)?â <a href="#top">â</a></p>
