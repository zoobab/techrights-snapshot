</p>
<p><em><b>Summary</b>: The convenient vacancy at the EPO’s top tier (astronomical salaries) and the International Labour Organisation’s investigation into it</em></p>
<p class="dropcap-first"><a name="top">T</a>HERE is a protest at the <a nicetitle="EPO" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/EPO">EPO</a>‘s headquarters <a href="https://twitter.com/FOSSpatents/status/666913543028088833">right about now</a> and again we’re on vacation while this happens (as incidentally was the case <em>twice</em> earlier this year). This calls for an urgent disclosure of more new information, at risk of compromising the quality of this article (I am writing this from my wife’s laptop). We were not planning to publish this fast, but the EPO’s shameful actions make it imperative. The EPO’s management has gone totally bonkers, verging on potentially criminal actions. They’re starting another war and they try to postpone their own inevitable defeat (there is already <a nicetitle="Dutch Political Action Against the EPO’s Management Greater Than Previously Estimated" href="http://techrights.org/2015/11/05/dutch-political-action-against-the-epos-management-greater-than-previously-estimated/">very heavy political intervention</a>, <a nicetitle="European Federation of Public Service Unions Pressures Dutch Prime Minister to Take Action Against the EPO’s Violations" href="http://techrights.org/2015/11/09/upsu-and-fnv-vs-epo/">approaching the Dutch Prime Minister</a>).</p>
<p>EPO matters such as this don’t require much explanation, just presentation of the <em>simple</em> facts. Anybody with some common sense can see what’s going on. In <a nicetitle="EPO: It’s Like a Family Business – Part I" href="http://techrights.org/2015/11/16/epo-family-business/">part one</a> we wrote about the unprecedented promotion of Elodie Bergot. The remainder of this series will shed more light and provide more relevant information about key players in “Team Battistelli”.</p>
<p>Before we begin part II we wish to provide some new information that may relate to what we’re about to publish. <a nicetitle="Florian Müller" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/Florian_M%C3%BCller">Florian Müller</a> has <a nicetitle="EPO labor dispute getting completely out of hand: three union leaders suspended, others pressured" href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2015/11/epo-labor-dispute-getting-completely.html">just made it publicly known that many people were attacked on Friday (not just in France) and we too had been bullied by the EPO</a>. As Müller put it: “The conflict between the leadership and staff representatives of the European Patent Office appears to be totally out of control now. The latest information would be unthinkable anywhere in the civilized world, but the European Patent Organization simply isn’t part of the civilized world around it.”</p>
<p>At a later point we are going to address the letter published by Müller, as it quite probably relates to the horrific atmosphere that results in many suicides. This is what Müller revealed about our own role in this: <em>“According to what I read on Twitter, TechRights blogger Dr. Roy Schestowitz (whose blog cannot be accessed from the EPO network without the use of software work-arounds for this kind of censorship) has also received legal threats from the EPO leadership. No details have become known yet.</em></p>
<p><em>“I have not been threatened so far, but I am deeply sorry for those who have been. Rumor has it that Mrs. Hardon and Dr. Schestowitz are not the only ones.</em></p>
<p><em>“It appears that Mrs. Hardon has decided to rather be proud and “suspended” than bow to lawlessness, corruption, and evil. I am so sorry for her and the other suspended union leaders, and I truly admire them for their steadfastness.</em></p>
<p><em>“Dr. Schestowitz also deserves the greatest respect for his principled stance. Despite all the bullying, he continues to call out the EPO leadership on its actions and decisions. Most recently, TechRights has started to talk about the unbelievable, extraordinary career path of Mrs. Elodie Bergot. It appears that the juiciest part of the story is actually not even on that blog but hidden somewhere between the lines of that post or the forthcoming one (Part II) on the same topic.</em></p>
<p><em>“TechRights is a blog I recommend all those concerned about the EPO’s corrupt ways to read regularly. I will write about EPO issues from time to time, but not nearly as often. Also, I wish to highlight the IP Kat blog’s announcement of forthcoming reports on staff suspensions and other EPO issues for this week.”</em></p>
<p>At the same time <em>IP Kat</em> wrote about something which may relates to <a nicetitle="Leaked: EPO Prioritises Work for Large Foreign Corporations, Discrimination Not Accidental But Centrally Planned" href="http://techrights.org/2015/10/11/closer-contact-with-major-applicants-leaked/">leaked documents that we published</a>. According to <a nicetitle="Plunging off the abyss -- or merely grinding to a halt? More bad news from Eponia" href="http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2015/11/plunging-off-abyss-or-merely-grinding.html">someone who wrote to <em>IP Kat</em></a>: <em>“We have a patent application which has been sitting untouched on an examiner’s desk in the EPO for over 10 years [this is ten; t-e-n. Not a typo] prior to the initiation of examination – we just received the first office action. The glaring conflict of interest is astounding.</em></p>
<p><em>“Has the EPO ever considered term-extensions, as in the US, for (significant) delays caused directly by the patent office? [No. Only national patent systems can extend patents, and that's not for delays in the course of the application-to-grant process] I would ask if they ever considered refunding annuities, or at least freezing them – but I am pretty sure I know the answer to that [You do indeed. It's another "no". ].”</em></p>
<p>This shows that EPO fails miserably both in technical terms and in ethical terms. The EPO tries to justify its abusive behaviour by arrogantly claiming improved “efficiency” or something along those lines; but whose efficiency? Large foreign corporations? The service provided by the EPO these days is a huge embarrassment to Europe. No wonder we see SMEs and their lawyers publicly complaining about the EPO online. The EPO is under fire even from its very own customers, not just its own employees (who are now demonstrating).</p>
<p>Now we begin our second part (of four), starting with Müller’s comments (direct quotes) on the first part [<a href="https://twitter.com/FOSSpatents/status/666536571139694592">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/FOSSpatents/status/666536680095133696">2</a>]. “That promotion [of Bergot],” he explained, “could indeed explain a different rumor I heard about Blatterstelli and won’t talk about in public. Or the other way round: that rumor could explain the promotion.”</p>
<p>The following points are worth noting about Bergot’s highly irregular promotion. In <a nicetitle="Judgment No. 2762" href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/triblex/triblexmain.detail?p_judgment_no=2562">Judgment No. 2562 of ILO</a> (which <a nicetitle="The International Labour Organisation Highlights Problems of Broader Dimensions at EPO" href="http://techrights.org/2015/10/30/international-labour-organisation-on-epo/">has been exceptionally concerned about the EPO's never-ending reports of abuses</a>), the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation (ILO-AT) dismissed a Complaint against a disputed appointment of an A6 official. In its Judgment, the ILO-AT pointed out that the Complainant lacked standing in a personal capacity because he was at the relevant time an employee at grade A3. Because of this: “He could not have been considered for appointment or transfer to any A6 position. He therefore does not have standing in his personal capacity.”</p>
<p>In his capacity as a staff representative, the Complainant was however found to have <a nicetitle="locus standi" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/locus-standi">locus standi</a> to bring a complaint on behalf of the Central Staff Committee.</p>
<p>What is significant here is that the ILO-AT, which is the international tribunal responsible for EPO staff disputes, has essentially taken the position that an appointment or transfer from staff grade A3 to A6, such as happened in the case of Ms Bergot, offends against the fundamental principles governing such matters.</p>
<p>According to information we have received, Bergot’s controversial promotion from A3 to A6 is the subject of an appeal which is currently pending before the Administrative Tribunal of the ILO. This growing pressure from the ILO-AT may help explain the crackdown of the EPO on staff representatives (the subject of a separate post — one which is yet to come). These staff representatives are not sources, whistleblowers or anything. They’re just seen as a threat by EPO management because they’re pursuing justice for the workers and they exercise basic rights (such as the right to assemble).</p>
<p>To say more about the ILO-AT jurisprudence, consider the following full text:</p>
<blockquote class="evidence"><p>
<b>105th Session</b></p>
<p><b>Judgment No. 2762</b></p>
<p>The Administrative Tribunal,</p>
<p>Considering the second complaint filed by Mr A. W. against the European Patent Organisation (EPO) on 13 December 2006 and corrected on 11 January 2007, the Organisation’s reply of 30 April, the complainant’s rejoinder of 22 June and the EPO’s surrejoinder of 6 September 2007;</p>
<p>Considering the applications to intervene filed by Messrs H. S. and W. M. on 22 June 2007 and by Messrs F. B., L. G., B. H., L. P. and L. R. M. on 2 July, and the letter of 18 July 2007 by which the Organisation indicated that it had no comments to make on those applications;</p>
<p>Considering Article II, paragraph 5, of the Statute of the Tribunal;</p>
<p>Having examined the written submissions;</p>
<p>Considering that the facts of the case and the pleadings may be summed up as follows:</p>
<p>A. The complainant, a German national, was born in 1969. He joined the European Patent Office, the EPO’s secretariat, on 1 September 1997 as an examiner. On 23 August 2004 the Office published vacancy notice EURO/3959, advertising a two-year contract for an administrative employee post at grade B5/B1. Of the 92 candidates who applied for the post, three were interviewed by the Selection Board, including Mrs P., the wife of the then President of the Office. In its report of 21 October 2004 the Selection Board recommended that Mrs P. be appointed to the post and that one of the other two candidates who had been interviewed be placed on a reserve<br>
list. Mrs P. was the successful candidate, and she took up her duties in November 2004.</p>
<p>By a letter to the President dated 10 February 2005 the complainant requested, in his capacity as chairman of the local Staff Committee in The Hague, a review of the decision to appoint Mrs P. He also signed, together with other staff representatives, a similar request made on behalf of the Central Staff Committee in a letter dated 15 February. Both letters stipulated that if the requests for review were refused, the letters were to be considered as internal appeals.</p>
<p>The complainant was informed by a letter of 17 March 2005 that the President considered that the relevant provisions of the Service Regulations for Permanent Employees of the European Patent Office had been applied correctly and that consequently the matter had been referred to the Internal Appeals Committee for an opinion. The two appeals were joined.</p>
<p>The parties did not request oral hearings. However, the three members of the Selection Board for the vacancy were heard in camera by the Committee during its examination of other internal appeals contesting Mrs P.’s recruitment, and the Committee took into account relevant evidence gathered during those hearings when examining the appeals submitted by the complainant and the other staff representatives. In its opinion of 10 August 2006 the Committee recommended by a majority that the appeal be dismissed as unfounded. The minority, however, drew attention to a number of “troubling anomalies/deficiencies/coincidences” and concluded that “the essential aim [of the selection procedure] was undoubtedly to secure a job for Mrs P. for the duration of her husband’s term as President in accordance with his expressed wish”. On 4 October 2006 the Vice-President in charge of Directorate-General 1 (DG1), acting on delegated authority, endorsed the recommendation of the majority of the Committee. That is the impugned decision.</p>
<p>B. The complainant questions the validity of the selection procedure for vacancy EURO/3959 on a number of grounds. He posits that that procedure was influenced by high-level authority within the Organisation, which would constitute an abuse of power. Even though the members of the Selection Board denied having been placed under explicit pressure to recommend Mrs P., this does not preclude the possibility that they were influenced by “indirect, subliminal pressure”. As evidence of this he contends that it is obvious that the Board members would try not to “displease the Authority” who makes decisions about their careers. He points out that the Selection Board considered the candidates’ international and diplomatic experience and external contacts, even though these criteria were not listed in the vacancy notice. One explanation for this, he suggests, is that they were impressed by Mrs P.’s background, adopted the criteria of their own accord and consequently considered irrelevant facts. Alternatively, the EPO misused its authority, applied indirect pressure and influenced the Board members by requesting that they adopt those criteria. If such pressure was applied, in the complainant’s view, this is direct evidence that the post was unlawfully tailored to fit Mrs P.’s qualifications. He also submits that during her interview Mrs P. expressed an expectation that her contract would be extended, and he questions whether a candidate would make such a statement unless that candidate was “virtually certain” to be recruited.</p>
<p>He alleges that prior to Mrs P.’s appointment the then President of the Office had declared his intention to recruit his wife, which clearly demonstrates that the selection procedure was to be pro forma. It is thus reasonable to assume that the result of the recruitment was predetermined. Regardless of whether the President did in fact influence the decision of the Selection Board, he put himself in a position arousing a reasonable suspicion that he had done so. Consequently, there was an actual, and not merely potential, conflict of interest. In the circumstances it was difficult, if not impossible, for the Board to act independently. Pursuant to the Service Regulations one member of the Board was appointed by the Staff Committee, and the President’s stated objective to recruit his wife “injured” the Staff Committee’s right to express an independent opinion through its appointee and to be equitably represented on the Board. By arranging a selection procedure which appeared proper, the President made the Staff Committee’s appointee an accomplice to nepotism, which brought injury to the Staff Committee as a whole.</p>
<p>The complainant requests the disclosure of the identities of the Selection Board members as well as an oral hearing in which the Board members, plus Mrs P. and Mr P., the former President of the EPO, are called as witnesses. He asks the Tribunal to quash the impugned decision, to annul Mrs P.’s appointment ab initio and to order “restitution of undue salaries and accrued benefits”. He also seeks a public apology, moral damages in the sum of one euro per staff member represented by him at the relevant time and costs.</p>
<p>C. In its reply the EPO argues that the complainant’s claim for a public apology is irreceivable because the Tribunal is not competent to grant such relief. Relying on the Tribunal’s case law, it also opposes his applications for disclosure and for an oral hearing. It further points out that the case law establishes that a decision by an international organisation to make an appointment is a discretionary one and as such is subject to only limited review by the Tribunal.</p>
<p>On the merits the Organisation submits that the Service Regulations establish conditions for the recruitment and appointment of staff which do not preclude the recruitment of staff members’ spouses. Consequently, the Selection Board was not in violation of the Service Regulations when it considered Mrs P.’s application and then recommended her as a suitable candidate. In addition, the President was not involved in his wife’s appointment as he had delegated authority for the recruitment of all non-examiner staff to the Vice-President in charge of Directorate-General 4 (DG4), who made the decision to recruit Mrs P. By delegating his authority, the President avoided a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>The EPO argues that the criteria used by the Selection Board were suitable given the duties and qualifications specified in vacancy notice EURO/3959. The Board exercised appropriate discretion in the selection of candidates, and no relevant facts were ignored in its unanimous recommendation, or indeed in the Vice-President’s decision.</p>
<p>Disagreeing with the minority opinion of the Internal Appeals Committee, the Organisation considers that the Selection Board acted in conformity with the Service Regulations by recommendingthat Mrs P. be appointed to the post and that another suitable candidate be placed on a reserve list.</p>
<p>With respect to the complainant’s allegations regarding abuse of power, the EPO denies that the post was tailored for Mrs P. and explains that the duties set out in the vacancy notice corresponded to the staffing needs of the unit to which the post was attached. As for the statement allegedly made by the President regarding his intention to recruit his wife, it observes that, even if he made such a statement, this is not proof that the Administration knew before the publication of vacancy notice that Mrs P. would apply for the post, nor is it possible to infer that the outcome of the selection procedure was predetermined.</p>
<p>The Organisation denies that the Selection Board was subjected to “subliminal pressure” and that the Staff Committee’s appointee on the Board was unable to act with a sufficient degree of independence. Furthermore, the Service Regulations provide that the fact of performing duties as an appointee of the Staff Committee “shall in no way be prejudicial to the person concerned”, and this statutory safeguard is reinforced by the Tribunal’s case law on the protection of freedom of association. The Selection Board issued a unanimous recommendation and the President cannot be held responsible for the opinion expressed by the Staff Committee’s appointee.</p>
<p>Contrary to the complainant’s view, the image of the Staff Committee was not injured, because such injury presupposes that there is public knowledge of the Selection Board’s unanimous recommendation for Mrs P.’s recruitment, and that will not be the case until the publication of the Tribunal’s decision in this matter.</p>
<p>D. In his rejoinder the complainant reiterates his arguments and presses his request for the examination of witnesses. He argues that it is unclear how the President’s delegation of authority to make appointments guaranteed independent appraisal of the facts with respect to Mrs P.’s recruitment. He further submits that the Staff Committee’s appointee on the Selection Board was derelict in his duty by not objecting to that recruitment, and that the fact that the recommendation was unanimous does not mean that the selection procedure was without flaws. It is clear that the Board was manifestly mistaken, because in contrast to the other candidate it considered suitable, Mrs P. did not have any international professional experience, nor any experience in the field of patents. By placing the other candidate on a reserve list the Board breached Annex II of the Service Regulations, which requires it to draw up the list of suitable candidates and then forward it to the appointing authority. The complainant concludes that the recruitment of Mrs P. was the result of unacceptable bias and a lack of objectivity.</p>
<p>E. In its surrejoinder the EPO maintains its position. It stresses that there is no question of new criteria not mentioned in the vacancy notice having been used during the selection procedure. It also considers that the complainant fails to respect the independence and freedom of speech enjoyed by the Staff Committee’s appointee. What the complainant criticises as a “dereliction of duty” was actually the appointee expressing an opinion that is different from that of the complainant.</p>
<p>CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>1. The complainant, an examiner at the EPO, is a deputy chairman of the Central Staff Committee and chairman of the local Staff Committee in The Hague.</p>
<p>2. On 23 August 2004 the EPO published a vacancy notice for a two-year contract administrative employee post at the B5/B1 grade in Directorate 5.1.1. The notice listed the following as the main duties of the post:</p>
<p>• maintenance of regular contacts and correspondence with national patent offices of the Member States;</p>
<p>• maintenance of regular contacts and correspondence with organisations such as the EC and other interested IP groups;</p>
<p>• provide general administrative support to the organisational unit responsible for relations with the Member States:</p>
<p>- preparation and organisation of missions; and</p>
<p>- establishing a database for contacts and file maintenance.</p>
<p>3. The minimum qualifications for the post included secondary education or in exceptional cases equivalent professional experience and “[w]orking knowledge of the EPO official languages”.</p>
<p>4. According to the complainant, in the course of conversations with the Chairman of the Central Staff Committee on 1 and 8 September 2004, the President of the Office stated that he made no secret of his intention to recruit his spouse to the EPO.</p>
<p>5. On 29 September 2004 the Munich Staff Committee appointed a replacement for its earlier nominee on the Selection Board established to deal with the above-noted vacancy. At the same time it lodged an objection to the content of the vacancy notice on the basis that the position described was in the nature of a permanent post. The Principal Director of Personnel responded that it was anticipated that in 2005/2006 there would be a need for a temporary strengthening of the administrative support for a number of cooperation projects with national offices.</p>
<p>6. In early October 2004 staff representatives in Vienna protested against the freeing of a vacancy in Munich for a position that, in their view, clearly fell within a Principal Directorate in Vienna.</p>
<p>7. In its report of 21 October 2004 the Selection Board noted that 92 applications had been received for the post. The Board invited three of the 92 applicants to be interviewed. One of the candidates invited for an interview was Mrs P., the President’s spouse. Of the three candidates interviewed, one was assessed as “not recommended”. Of the two remaining candidates, the Board found one to be “suitable”, but as she was the second-best candidate it recommended that she be placed on a reserve list. The Board recommended Mrs P. for the post. In its report, it stated:</p>
<p>“[...] She has excellent professional experience, and is clearly more than able to perform the duties set out in the vacancy notice. She is accustomed to dealing with high-ranking people; she also has broad international experience and a desire to make the project a success. She speaks very good English and adequate German.”</p>
<p>8. Mrs P. was appointed to the post effective 15 November 2004. Her appointment was subsequently extended to 30 June 2007, the date on which the President’s tenure was due to end.</p>
<p>9. In February 2005 the complainant, in his capacity as chairman of the local Staff Committee in The Hague, submitted a request to the President of the Office for review of the decision to appoint Mrs P. The Central Staff Committee submitted a similar request. The President considered that the relevant provisions had been applied correctly and referred the matter to the Internal Appeals Committee. Given that the subject matter of the two requests was identical, the appeals were joined.</p>
<p>10. In March 2006, in the context of another appeal brought against Mrs P.’s recruitment, the Internal Appeals Committee interviewed the members of the Selection Board in camera. The evidence obtained during these interviews was also used for the purposes of the complainant’s appeal.</p>
<p>11. During the interviews, the three members of the Selection Board, M1 (appointed by Personnel), M2 (appointed by the Staff Committee), and M3 (appointed by the department to which the post was attached) denied being under any pressure to select a particular candidate and supported the ultimate recommendation.</p>
<p>12. M1 stated that although the number of candidates selected for interviews was low, it was within the normal range for a B-grade post.</p>
<p>13. M2 stated that he had the impression that the post was tailored to Mrs P. and noted that at the interview Mrs P. had responded to one of his questions by stating that she expected her two-year contract to be extended for an additional year. He also stated that the Principal Director of Personnel had called him and said that “he hoped for a good outcome to the selection procedure”. M2 claimed that he would not allow himself to be pressured and stated that he answered accordingly.</p>
<p>14. M3 explained why the post had been created and stated that a typing error was the only explanation he could offer for the job description having been dated 26 July 2004 and pre-dating the vacancy announcement. He maintained, however, that it had been signed much later.</p>
<p>15. The Internal Appeals Committee, by a three to two majority, recommended that the appeal be dismissed as unfounded. On 4 October 2006 the Vice-President of DG1, to whom the President had delegated the authority to make the decision, endorsed the opinion of the majority and dismissed the appeal as unfounded. That is the<br>
decision the complainant impugns before the Tribunal.</p>
<p>16. The complainant alleges that the impugned decision is tainted with procedural and substantive errors, abuse of authority, conflict of interest, bias and bad faith.</p>
<p>17. Before turning to the submissions, it is useful to reiterate that given the nature of an organisation’s decision to make an appointment, the Tribunal will only intervene if the decision was taken without authority, or in breach of a rule of form or of procedure, or if it rested on an error of fact or of law, or if some essential fact was overlooked, or if there was abuse of authority, or if clearly mistaken conclusions were drawn from the evidence. Further, the Tribunal will not substitute its assessment for that of the organisation.</p>
<p>18. As to the procedural errors, the complainant submits that the Selection Board’s application of criteria which were not listed in the vacancy notice and which were not necessary given the grade of the post, violated Article 5 of Annex II to the Service Regulations. Further, the Board violated Article 5, paragraph 4, by placing only one name on the “list” of suitable candidates. Lastly, the complainant submits that the EPO has failed to prove a proper delegation of the decision-making authority.</p>
<p>19. The Organisation contends that a good mastery of the EPO’s official languages, experience working as an assistant or secretary and an international background are criteria that fit within the vacancy notice, particularly since one of the main duties identified in the notice was fostering contacts with the national patent offices of Member States. Regarding the alleged violation of the above-mentioned Article 5, paragraph 4, the EPO submits that having regard to the Selection Board’s report, it is clear that the Board gave its assessment of all three candidates interviewed, made a reasoned report and found that two of the candidates were suitable. The EPO submits also that the President’s decision-making authority was properly delegated in accordance with a Note to the President dated 9 June 1998.</p>
<p>20. In its report of 21 October 2004 the Selection Board stated that in establishing its shortlist of candidates to be interviewed “special emphasis was placed on work experience in ‘assistant’ capacity – preferably in an international environment – and on excellent language knowledge, particularly of French and English”.</p>
<p>21. It is clear that work experience as an assistant preferably in an international environment is directly related to the main duties described in the vacancy notice. However, by placing emphasis on “excellent language knowledge, particularly of French and English”, the Selection Board modified and added to the language requirement in the vacancy notice, which specified a “working knowledge of the EPO official languages”. The focus on an excellent knowledge of French and English is not explained by the Board, nor can it be said that it is related to the duties of the post. This is not akin to a finding that those candidates with a higher level of proficiency in all three languages required by the vacancy notice were more qualified. That would be the case if the Board had used the criterion of excellent knowledge of the EPO’s three official languages for the purpose of preparing a shortlist of candidates to be interviewed. In effect, however, the Board narrowed the language criterion by raising the standard on only part of the requirement. Despite the content of the vacancy notice, a candidate with a working knowledge of the three official languages as specified in the vacancy notice could not be successful.</p>
<p>22. The Tribunal also finds that the procedure adopted by the Selection Board violates Article 5, paragraph 4, of Annex II to the Service Regulations, which states:</p>
<p>“On completion of its proceedings, the Selection Board shall draw up the list of suitable candidates provided for in Article 7 of the Service Regulations; the list shall whenever possible contain more names than the number of posts<br>
to be filled.</p>
<p>The Selection Board shall forward this list to the appointing authority, together with a reasoned report by the Selection Board including any comments its members may wish to make.”</p>
<p>Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Service Regulations reads:</p>
<p>“For each competition, a selection board, the composition of which is laid down in Annex II, shall be appointed by the appointing authority. This board shall draw up a list of suitable candidates.</p>
<p>The appointing authority shall decide which of these candidates to appoint to the vacant post.”</p>
<p>23. Although the parties focused their debate on the meaning of “whenever possible” in Article 5, paragraph 4, of Annex II, it is clear from Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Service Regulations that all candidates found to be “suitable” must be placed on the list. In the present case, in addition to Mrs P., a second candidate was also found to be “suitable”. However, she was not included on the list for consideration by the appointing authority. By not placing the second candidate on the list, the Selection Board, in effect, determined the outcome of the competition.</p>
<p>24. The validity of a delegation of authority is premised on the delegator having the power or authority to take the action in question. In the present case, it is doubtful whether the powers conferred on the President extended to the appointment of his spouse to a post in the EPO. However, that point has not been raised. Leaving this aside, as to the question of the delegation of authority, although it is not entirely clear that the document upon which the EPO relies in fact supports its assertion that the decision-maker was acting under properly delegated authority, the real issue is whether the fact that the President has delegated his authority to select the successful candidate to another official adequately protects the integrity of the selection process. For the reasons set out below in consideration 27, in the Tribunal’s view it does not.</p>
<p>25. While the above procedural flaws alone would be sufficient to warrant setting aside the impugned decision, given that the main thrust of the complaint is the allegation of abuse of authority, conflict of interest, bias and bad faith, some further comment is required. At this juncture, it should be noted that in the complainant’s submissions there is no separate analysis for each of these allegations. Instead, the complainant uses the terms almost interchangeably. For the purpose of this discussion, it is not necessary to engage in a separate legal analysis for each of the allegations.</p>
<p>26. The Organisation is correct in stating that the Service Regulations do not preclude the recruitment of the spouses of staff members. Nor does there appear to be any regulatory bar to the recruitment of the spouses, friends, or close associates of the highest ranking officials in the Organisation. Whether this type of recruitment ought to be permitted is not for the Tribunal to decide but is a question of policy for each organisation to answer.</p>
<p>27. However, where an organisation permits such recruitment, then it is imperative that special procedures be put in place to ensure the integrity and transparency of the selection process. Where such procedures have not been put in place, the presumptions of regularity and bona fides will not apply. In the absence of the operation of these presumptions, it will take very little to establish improper motive or bad faith.</p>
<p>28. In the present case, the complainant and, in turn, the minority of the Internal Appeals Committee have identified a host of “troubling anomalies/deficiencies/coincidences” surrounding the selection process. While any one of these when viewed in isolation may not support an allegation of abuse of authority, conflict of interest, bias and bad faith, when taken together they demonstrate at a minimum that the decision to recruit Mrs P. was taken in bad faith.</p>
<p>29. In view of the above findings, the complainant’s request for an oral hearing is rejected.</p>
<p>30. In conclusion, the impugned decision must be set aside. The complainant also seeks the following additional relief:</p>
<p>(1) annulment of Mrs P.’s appointment <em>ab initio</em>, with restitution of undue salaries and accrued benefits;</p>
<p>(2) a public apology;</p>
<p>(3) moral damages of one euro per staff member whom the complainant represented at the “relevant time”; and</p>
<p>(4) costs.</p>
<p>31. The request that Mrs P.’s appointment be annulled coupled with the requirement to repay any salaries and benefits she received appears to be grounded on the complainant’s allegation that Mrs P. colluded with her husband to obtain the appointment. This allegation appears to rest on a statement Mrs P. made at her interview to the effect that she expected her contract to be renewed. As it is not entirely clear from the witness’s statement what was actually said or intended, this claim for relief will be dismissed, as will the claim for a public apology because it is beyond the Tribunal’s power to make such order.</p>
<p>32. In his representative capacity, the complainant has not suffered any actual pecuniary damage. He is entitled to moral damages, however, which the Tribunal assesses at an amount equivalent to one euro per staff member of the EPO, as he has requested. The Tribunal also awards the complainant costs in the amount of 1,000 euros.</p>
<p>33. Seven other staff representatives applied under Article 13, paragraph 1, of the Tribunal’s Rules to intervene in the complaint. Their applications are allowed and the benefit of the present judgment including the award of moral damages shall be extended to them.</p>
<p>DECISION</p>
<p>For the above reasons,</p>
<p>1. The impugned decision is set aside.</p>
<p>2. The Organisation shall pay moral damages to the complainant and the interveners as representatives of the Staff Committee in an amount equivalent to one euro per staff member.</p>
<p>3. It shall pay the complainant costs in the amount of 1,000 euros.</p>
<p>4. All other claims are dismissed.</p>
<p>In witness of this judgment, adopted on 16 May 2008, Ms Mary G. Gaudron, Vice-President of the Tribunal, Mr Giuseppe Barbagallo, Judge, and Ms Dolores M. Hansen, Judge, sign below, as do I, Catherine Comtet, Registrar.</p>
<p>Delivered in public in Geneva on 9 July 2008.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To better understand why the  staff representatives are being so viciously attacked right now, read 33 above. It’s quite revealing that the EPO’s management is more interested in cracking down on messengers than in cracking down on its own abuses/abusers.</p>
<p>Among the accusations — defended using factual observations — were tailoring of a job description (for a vacancy) to Bergot’s relatively limited set of skills. How might those other 92 candidates (likely far better qualified), some of whom got invited for an interview, feel about this if they knew that one special skill they lacked was being the spouse of the President’s buddy? Or to put it more crudely, sleeping with Battistelli’s confidant? Many of these candidates probably don’t even know and Bergot’s different surname (from her husband’s) wouldn’t help them. </p>
<p>In conclusion, it may be worth looking at what the jurisprudence of the ILO-AT says about the recruitment of “the spouses, friends, or close associates of the high ranking officials” in an International Organisation such as the EPO.</p>
<p>ILO-AT Judgment No. 2762 concerned a case in which a former EPO President (Alain Pompidou) had secured an appointment at the EPO for his spouse.</p>
<p>In its conclusions the ILO-AT stated the following: <em>“26. The Organisation is correct in stating that the Service Regulations do not preclude the recruitment of the spouses of staff members. Nor does there appear to be any regulatory bar to the recruitment of the spouses, friends, or close associates of the highest ranking officials in the Organisation. Whether this type of recruitment ought to be permitted is not for the Tribunal to decide but is a question of policy for each organisation to answer.</em></p>
<p><em>“27. However, where an organisation permits such recruitment, then it is imperative that special procedures be put in place to ensure the integrity and transparency of the selection process. Where such procedures have not been put in place, the presumptions of regularity and bona fides will not apply. In the absence of the operation of these presumptions, it will take very little to establish improper motive or bad faith.</em>” </p>

Gene Quinn, one of the loudest proponents of software patents, is still quite loud about it.

It’s expected. “One might think,” Quinn writes, “that just about everything that can be said about Alice has already been said, but that is unfortunately not the case.”</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 200px;">“They are striving to change the status quo by changing perceptions.”</span>Actually, what we appear to be seeing since the ruling (nearly a year and a half ago) is thousands of patent lawyers babbling about it and saturating the media with spin.

In a new development in the patent and trademark world, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued an additional U.S. Patent to E-ImageData relating to its digital microform imaging technology (U.S. Patent No. 9,179,019). E-ImageData is a renowned name in the field of Imaging Data Technology which is powering most prestigious libraries and private companies across the globe.”</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 300px;">“What does the presence of so many patent trolls tell us about the US patent system?”</span>Notice how quickly the patent numbers are rising (approaching 10 million). It’s not bizarre given that <a nicetitle="The US Patent System is Only Getting Worse as 92% of Patent Applications Now ‘Successful’, Everything Under the Sun Patented" href="http://techrights.org/2014/05/09/patenting-every-silly-idea/">around 92% of patent applications in the US are eventually accepted</a>. This just serves to show how ludicrous it has become and the <a nicetitle="EPO" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/EPO">EPO</a> under Battistelli goes down a similar route right now (<a nicetitle="EPO Slammed for Granting Patents on Life" href="http://techrights.org/2015/10/25/epo-patents-on-life/">patents on life</a> too <a nicetitle="The EPO is Criticised Again for Serving the Monsanto (and Syngenta) Agenda" href="http://techrights.org/2015/11/16/epo-monsanto-agenda/">are being accepted</a>, not to mention <a nicetitle="Software Patents in Europe" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/Software_Patents_in_Europe">software patents</a>).</p>
<p>There are <a nicetitle="The great American stagnation — or acceleration?" href="https://www.aei.org/events/the-great-american-stagnation-or-acceleration/">new debates about patents’ impact on or correlation to the US economy</a>. These will be focused on patent trolls. What does the presence of so many patent trolls tell us about the US patent system? This <a nicetitle="Texas Emerges as the Favorite Place for Patent Trolls this Year" href="http://sagaciousresearch.com/blog/texas-emerges-as-the-favorite-place-for-patent-trolls-this-year/">new blog post</a> says that “Texas Emerges as the Favorite Place for Patent Trolls this Year” (<a nicetitle="EFF Asks CAFC to Tackle the Trolls’ Docket, the Eastern District of Texas" href="http://techrights.org/2015/11/03/eastern-district-of-texas/">as usual</a>). To quote: “Texas Emerges as the Favorite Place for Patent Trolls this Year. Patent trolling is common but emergence of nearly half of all patent case filings from a single federal court district in a remote part of the country is something that is uncommon and unusual. But, same is the case with East Texas which has emerged as the single largest battle ground for most of the patent infringement lawsuits filed by various players and companies in the United States. According to reports around 44 percent of patent lawsuits have been filed in the Eastern District of Texas Court alone in this financial year which is a point to consider.”</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 200px;">“We are going to say a lot more about patent scope in Europe and its impact.”</span>The sad thing is that there is hardly any talk anymore about US patent reform and the <a nicetitle="SCOTUS" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/SCOTUS">SCOTUS</a> has just formally sided with patent monopolies by <a nicetitle="U.S. Supreme Court rejects LCD screen patent appeal" href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/11/16/us-usa-court-eidos-idINKCN0T527720151116">rejecting an appeal</a>. To quote yesterday’s report from <em>Reuters</em>: “The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal filed by manufacturers of liquid crystal displays that are contesting claims that they infringe on a patent held by Eidos Display.”</p>
<p>Where does it all leave us? Well, we spoke to a former EPO patent examiner, who told us it had become a big issue. This examiner wanted to send us a scanned version of Chapter 3 from the following recent book, which he thinks should generally interest us. “The title says it all,” said this person, <a nicetitle="Exclusions from Patentability -- How Far Has the European Patent Office Eroded Boundaries?" href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/intellectual-property/exclusions-patentability-how-far-has-european-patent-office-eroded-boundaries">“Exclusions from Patentability — How Far Has the European Patent Office Eroded Boundaries?”</a></p>
<p>We are going to say a lot more about patent scope in Europe and its impact. We shall do so some time in the near future.  There are currently more urgent articles about the EPO in our pipeline. <a href="#top">█</a></p>

							<p><em>Still in pursuit of answers from the “Open Organization” [sic]</em></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="airport-1449503.jpg" alt="Mirrors at airport">
</p>
<p><em><b>Summary</b>: Quick progress report about the effort to convince Red Hat to explain its patent standstill — whatever that practically means — with Microsoft</em></p>
<p class="dropcap-first"><a name="top">I</a>N THE political spheres or most political media it is widely recognised that in order to discourage certain policies and certain types of behaviour one might need to shame those who propose or exercise any such policy or action, respectively. This, for example, is why we criticise proponents of software patents and even Red Hat’s patent agreement with Microsoft. The example they give to others is dangerous and without public challenge it can carry on and even expand.</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 230px;">“The example they give to others is dangerous and without public challenge it can carry on and even expand.”</span>Red Hat should be based in Raleigh, not Red Mond [sic], where Red Hat now sends its engineers to work under Microsoft leadership while receiving salaries from Red Hat. We had a long chat about this with someone from Red Hat last night. We still hope that Red Hat will decide to do the right thing. Like Novell’s Cambridge lab, which it used along with Microsoft to promote Microsoft’s agenda, now we have Red Hat staff sharing space with Microsoft staff. Microsoft is a proponent of software patents and still insists that Linux players should pay Microsoft for patents. So how can one reconcile or compromise? In <a nicetitle="Open Letter to James Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat" href="http://techrights.org/2007/12/21/open-letter-james-whitehurst/">our Open Letter to Red Hat’s new CEO (Jim Whitehurst) 8 years ago</a> we told him that it is “hard to name companies that have benefited from a Microsoft pact” (this is <em>still</em> true).</p>
<p>We will continue to wait and give Red Hat an opportunity to explain what was done with Microsoft regarding patents. We encourage others to ask Red Hat those questions as well. If public pressure is sufficient to influence Red Hat’s PR/marketing experts, Red Hat will decide to open up. For a company steered by shareholders it all boils down to money and reputation. <a href="#top">█</a></p>
<p><font size="4"><em>“What we [Novell and Microsoft] agreed, which is true, is we’ll continue to try to grow Windows share at the expense of Linux. That’s kind of our job. But to the degree that people are going to deploy Linux, we want Suse Linux to have the highest percent share of that, because only a customer who has Suse Linux actually has paid properly for the use of intellectual property from Microsoft. And we took a quota, you could say, to help them sell so much Suse Linux. That’s part of the deal. We are willing to do the same deal with Red Hat and other Linux distributors, it’s not an exclusive thing. But after a few years of working on this problem, Novell actually saw the business opportunity, because there’s so many customers who say, ‘Hey look, we don’t want problems. We don’t want any intellectual property problem or anything else. There’s just a variety of workloads where we, today, feel like we want to run Linux. Please help us Microsoft and please work with the distributors to solve this<br>
problem, don’t come try to license this individually.’ So customer push drove us to where we got.”</em></font></p>

<p><em><b>Summary</b>: The involvement of Microsoft Windows in mission-critical systems (where many lives are on the line) shows extreme negligence and lack of foresight</em></p>
<p><font size="5"><b><a name="top">F</a></b></font>RANCE appears to have had problems other than terrorism. Headlines today serve to confirm, with Russia’s acceptance too, that its plane was recently taken down by terrorists, killing about twice as many people as died in Paris on Friday. Days ago the British media ran some scare stories about a French person in a British airport (a lot of misreporting about that, see our daily links for more), but how about basic <em>technological</em> errors? Remember <a nicetitle="Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NASA Should Remove Windows, Adopt GNU/Linux After Spanair Findings" href="http://techrights.org/2010/08/26/aviation-and-windows-2/">what happened</a> to a <a nicetitle="What Spanair Crash and BP Disaster Have in Common: Microsoft Windows in Alarm Systems" href="http://techrights.org/2010/08/24/when-windows-kills/">Spanair flight</a> and also the poor judgment of <a nicetitle="Time to Take Microsoft Out of British Aviation Before Planes Crash Into Buildings" href="http://techrights.org/2014/12/13/british-aviation-and-microsoft/">British aviation</a>. More planes crash due to technical malfunction than due to terrorism.</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 300px;">“Microsoft seems to be good at nothing these days, perhaps other than back doors and back room deals.”</span>Based on a new report, France is still running mission-critical systems with Windows, even really ancient versions of it, as ancient as 3.1 (see <em>“Windows 3.1 Is Still Alive, And It Just Killed a French Airport”</em> in [1] below). What are they thinking? This is just nuts! It’s not from <em>The Onion</em> and it’s definitely no satire.</p>
<p>Microsoft seems to be good at nothing these days, perhaps other than back doors and back room deals. Recall Microsoft’s new body cameras partnership with TASER, <a nicetitle="Microsoft’s Poaching Efforts (Against GNU/Linux) Advance, Don’t Fall Into the Trap" href="http://techrights.org/2015/10/31/the-azure-trap/">which we</a> mentioned <a nicetitle="SourceClear: Yet Another Microsoft-Connected (Coming From Microsoft) FOSS FUD Firm" href="http://techrights.org/2015/10/27/sourceclear-and-microsoft/">a few times</a>, then see [2,3] below. Conficker, a Windows virus, is now being preinstalled on body cameras. How many lives will likely be sacrificed as a result of this? Police brutality too needlessly kills a lot of people.</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 200px;">“Haven’t Snowden’s leaks shown enough to convince everyone that <em>genuine</em> security is not the goal at Microsoft but actually somewhat of a foe?”</span>Windows is not suitable for anything that requires security because Windows is simply not designed to be secure. It’s designed for “national security” (meaning back doors and bogus encryption that the state can crack). Proprietary software in general is bad, including firmware [4], based on new reports. Microsoft is now <a nicetitle="Microsoft quietly slips out patched patch for Outlook – in camouflage" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/16/microsofts_fixed_outlook_patch/">silently modifying its patches</a> after it bricked Outlook, which has back doors. To quote the British media: <em>“Many IT managers and normal folks held off on last week’s patching cycle after one Microsoft fix – KB 3097877 – broke several versions of Outlook. The error came in how the software handled fonts, and resulted in the email client crashing as soon as some emails were scrolled through.”</em></p>
<p>We have already <a nicetitle="Microsoft BitLocker Has Bug/Back Doors, Windows Laptop/Desktop Encryption Just a Farce" href="http://techrights.org/2015/11/14/microsoft-bitlocker-has-bugback-doors-windows-laptopdesktop-encryption-just-a-farce/">covered this here the other day</a>, <a nicetitle="Former Microsoft Engineer Working on Windows BitLocker Confirms Government Asks Microsoft for Back Doors" href="http://techrights.org/2014/07/31/microsoft-back-doors-admission/">in relation to back doors in Microsoft data encryption</a>. It is unthikable and rather unbelievable that some people still get away with putting Windows in mission-critical systems, even in governments and businesses. Haven’t Snowden’s leaks shown enough to convince everyone that <em>genuine</em> security is not the goal at Microsoft but actually somewhat of a foe? <a href="#top">█</a></p>

<blockquote><p>A computer glitch that brought the Paris airport of Orly to a standstill Saturday has been traced back to the airport’s “prehistoric” operating system. In an article published Wednesday, French satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaîné (which often writes serious stories, such as this one) said the computer failure had affected a system known as DECOR, which is used by air traffic controllers to communicate weather information to pilots. Pilots rely on the system when weather conditions are poor.</p>
<p>DECOR, which is used in takeoff and landings, runs on Windows 3.1, an operating system that came onto the market in 1992. Hardly state-of-the-art technology. One of the highlights of Windows 3.1 when it came out was the inclusion of Minesweeper — a single-player video game that was responsible for wasting hours of PC owners’ time in the early ’90s.</p></blockquote>

<p>There were more than a dozen body camera companies on the show floor, but Taser made the biggest splash, constructing a Disney-style amphitheater called the USS Axon Enterprise. The show began with a white-jacketed captain, who announced he had traveled back in time from the year 2055, where lethal force has been eliminated and police are respected and loved by their communities. To explain how to get there, he ran through a history of policing tech. Approaching the present moment, he fell into a kind of disappointed sadness.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Users of Linux-based operating systems often buy Windows-powered computers, format the hard drive and install their favorite distro. This can sometimes be a fine experience, although, quite often, it comes with annoyances such as non-working hardware (usually Wi-Fi). Not to mention, the keyboard will likely house a “Windows” key, which taints the experience.</p>
<p>The holy grail for many Linux users — besides building their own computer — is to get a desktop or laptop that comes pre-loaded with a Linux-based operating system. One of the most popular such manufacturers, System76, sells computers pre-loaded with Ubuntu, including a lifetime of telephone tech support. Obviously the company has accumulated many fans over the years, so this past Thursday and Friday, it held its first-ever superfan event. Fans were flown to its Denver headquarters. I was honored to be given the opportunity to cover it.</p></blockquote>

<h5><a href="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/kubuntu-werewolf.html" rel="nofollow">Kubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf – Pretty useless</a></h5>
<blockquote><p> I heard there’s been a change of management with the Kubuntu community or some sort like that. Well, perhaps it’s for the greater good. I am quite close to abandoning Kubuntu forever. Much like PCLinuxOS, it’s slowly creeping toward irrelevance, offering none of the love and fire that you’d want and expect. It’s exhausted, it’s defeated. It just doesn’t try to win you in any way. It’s there because it exists. Nothing more.</p>
<p>Moreover, there’s the matter of inconsistency. I mentioned this before, and I will mention it again. I absolutely loathe when things break in between releases. Small, simple things. Like Samba or printing or codecs. Why? WHY? WHY! How difficult is it to try to offer a sane, steady user experience? Why do I have to dread every single update? You can never really know. One version, things work, and then they don’t. Samba sharing. Year 2015. How difficult can it be to copy files from one frigging computer to another without problems? It’s not like sending probes to Mars. Just a bloody copy operation, source destination. Simple.</p>
<p>On top of that, Kubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf literally fails in every aspect. It’s totally useless, it’s buggy, it’s crashy, and it offers nothing that would make it even remotely interesting. Nothing useful or practical about it really. Nothing. I’m sad. And angry. Avoid at all costs. 0/10. Bye bye now. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It’s not enough to mitigate this ban on open source by partial mitigation to allow secret disclosure to governments. Our perspective is that simply having source made available for viewing by select parties is not sufficient. Source code related to public regulatory matters should be released under an OSI approved license and thus made available to all those who use the software. Doing so allows them to study, improve and share the software as well as to check that their lives are not negatively impacted by its defects. Ideally, all software written using public funds should also be made available as open source.</p>
<p>There’s much else in TPP to be concerned about, as the EFF notes, but this clause is especially regressive and is cause alone to reject the agreement. The clock is ticking — President Obama notified Congress on November 5 that he intends to ratify TPP on behalf of the USA — so the time to protest is now.</p></blockquote>

<p>Open source innovation is a phrase we tend to associate with post-millennial creativity, but it’s actually a 300-year-old idea. Benjamin Franklin famously did not patent his lighting rod, his bifocals, his stove, and many other of his inventions because he thought that these ideas were simply too important not to share.</p>

He’s even making his own security contributions to the amazing open source Android email application, K-9. His keynote at OSCON 2014 was about threats – threats to our privacy, threats to our online freedoms and threats to our data, and “Now is the time for sensible, reasonable, extreme paranoia,” as he puts it.

<blockquote><p>There’s another place to watch for antibiotic overuse: the meat your children are eating, whether beef, pork, turkey or chicken. As a result, the country’s leading pediatrics group is calling for farmers to stop using antibiotics to help livestock grow faster.  </p>
<p>In a report Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics detailed the overuse of antibiotics in animals, which can make bacteria such as salmonella, E. coli and Campylobacter stronger and resistant to drugs previously able to fight them off. The federal government has been warning Americans about the dangers of overusing antibiotics in hospitals and of asking doctors to prescribe them when they aren’t necessary, but what hasn’t received as much widespread attention is the danger that can occur when these medicines are overfed to animals, the academy wrote.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In a new technical report, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) argues that unnecessary use of antibiotics in livestock is fueling drug-resistant, life-threatening infections in humans, particularly young children. The report, published Monday in Pediatrics, recommends limiting the use of antibiotics on farms.</p>
<p>As Ars has reported before, the vast majority of antibiotics used in the US go to agriculture and aquaculture—about 80 percent of total tonnage, to be exact. Those drugs are often given to livestock to fatten them up or prevent future illness. Such doses of drugs, many of which have crossovers in human medicine, can spur drug-resistant microbes that may make their way off the farm and spread to food or share their drug-resistant genes with other microbes, the AAP noted.</p></blockquote>

<p>Belgian interior minister Jan Jambon ignited the speculation over the weekend when he complained that communications over PlayStation 4 are extremely hard to spy on.

<blockquote><p> We’ve talked a lot in the past few years about the desperate need to reform the CFAA — an absolutely horrible “anti-hacking” law that has been stretched and broadened and twisted by people over the years, such that it’s frequently used to “pile on” charges when nothing else will stick. If you want to go into a lot more detail, you can listen to the podcast we recently did about the CFAA, or listen to this wonderful podcast that Reply All did about the CFAA (where I also make a brief appearance). But one of the biggest problems with it is that it considers you to be a dangerous hacker if you access a computer/network “without authorization” or if you merely have “exceeded authorized access.” It’s that latter phrase that often causes trouble. What does it even mean? Historically, cases have been brought against employees who use their employer’s computers for non-work related things, against someone for supposedly failing to abide by MySpace’s terms of service and for downloading too many academic journals that were freely available for downloading on MIT’s campus network. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The diary of Anne Frank is just six weeks away from entering the public domain in most of Europe—but it might not happen. The Basel-based Anne Frank Fonds, which owns the copyright, has a plan to retain ownership until 2050.</p>
<p>Anne Frank and her family famously hid from the Nazis in occupied Amsterdam during World War Two. They were ultimately discovered, and Anne died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Her father, Otto Frank, survived the Holocaust and published her diaries and notebooks.</p>
<p>Most European copyrights end 70 years after the author’s death, meaning that on Jan. 1, 2016, the diary becomes public domain in much of the continent. But the Anne Frank foundation has a new legal strategy to keep its most valuable copyright: declare that Otto Frank is actually a “co-author” of the diaries, not merely an editor. Since Otto Frank died in 1980, anything he authored will stay under copyright until 2050. (The book was first published in the US in 1952, so copyright stateside will last until 2047 regardless of what happens in Europe.)</p>
<p>This weekend’s New York Times carried the news that the foundation is issuing an “early warning” to publishers that they aren’t allowed to freely publish the diary. That’s led to criticism of the foundation, including some who have threatened to begin publishing the diary online, whether the foundation likes it or not.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jono Bacon, from GitHub and Red Hat’s “Open Organization” [sic] marketing campaign, defends the companies’ new relationship (as he would defend his former employer, Canonical, as well). Citing a sort of Microsoft proxy and <a nicetitle="Red Hat Makes an Error by Liaising With Proprietary Software Firm and Source of FUD, Supposedly for ‘Security’" href="http://techrights.org/2015/10/21/red-hat-and-black-duck/">a new Red Hat partner</a> (<a nicetitle="Black Duck" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/Black_Duck">Black Duck</a>), he frames this relationship as necessary and <a nicetitle="Red Hat CEO and Microsoft EVP On The Evolution Of Open Source And Business" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonobacon/2015/11/16/red-hat-ceo-and-microsoft-evp-on-the-evolution-of-open-source-and-business/">recalls that</a> “Microsoft went a step further with then-CEO Steve Ballmer describing the poster-child of the open source revolution, Linux, as “a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.”</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 300px;">“Red Hat is living in a dream if it genuinely believes that a deal with Microsoft will leave them better off than Linspire or Novell.”</span>Well, based on Nadella’s actions against <a nicetitle="Microsoft Reportedly Uses Patent Blackmail Against Android to Force Samsung to Spread Microsoft Spyware (Incorporated Into Android) (Updated)" href="http://techrights.org/2015/02/14/patent-blackmail-tactic/">Samsung</a>, <a nicetitle="There is No ‘New Microsoft’: Under Nadella, Patent Extortion Against Linux/Android Carries on" href="http://techrights.org/2015/07/06/microsoft-vs-kyocera-android/">Kyocera</a>, and <a nicetitle="Another Reason to Boycott Dell: Support for Microsoft’s Racketeering" href="http://techrights.org/2014/03/27/support-microsoft-racketeering/">Dell</a> (there are more examples), he too views Linux as “a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.” Nadella insists on <em>still</em> using patents against Linux, and against Android in particular (using patents pertaining to the kernel, Linux).</p>
<p>Under Nadella’s management, Microsoft is even trying to <a nicetitle="Media Reports Based on New Patents Suggest That Microsoft Continues to Attack Google and Android/Linux, Trying to Tax and Delete Android" href="http://techrights.org/2015/10/06/eee-deleting-android/">delete Android from phones</a> (we first <a nicetitle="Microsoft Hates Linux – Part IV – Deleting, Attacking Android/Linux From Within" href="http://techrights.org/2015/03/21/microsoft-deleting-android/">took note of this at the beginning of this year</a> and <a nicetitle="Microsoft’s Latest Anti-Linux Strategy: Deleting Android From Android Devices" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/03/deleting-android/">later on</a>) or even absorb its software into Windows — a strategy which Microsoft reportedly did in fact consider [2]. It’s like a derivative of the famous “embrace, extend, extinguish” strategy. Under Nadella there was also further lockdown of <a nicetitle="UEFI" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/UEFI">UEFI</a>, impeding or making impossible installation of GNU/Linux on PCs that come with <a nicetitle="Vista 10 Reality Log" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/Vista_10_Reality_Log">Microsoft’s unpopular spyware</a>.</p>
<p>Red Hat is living in a dream if it genuinely believes that a deal with Microsoft will leave them better off than Linspire or Novell. Or maybe it can leave Red Hat just better off than everyone else in the GNU/Linux world. Red Hat’s patent agreement with Microsoft, concurrent with Microsoft attacking Android (with software patents), is truly problematic and we will escalate if Red Hat does not respond to us or becomes transparent by the end of this month. A lot of people want answers. The  “Open Organization” [sic] ignores these people. It’s inherently antithetical to players in a community of developers. <a href="#top">█</a></p>

<p class="dropcap-first"><a name="top">T</a>HE <a nicetitle="EPO" href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/EPO">EPO</a> coverage continues with a series focusing on <a nicetitle="EPO Appointments: Standards of a Third World Country" href="http://techrights.org/2015/07/10/epo-appointments/">dubious appointments inside this organisation (which quickly morphed into what we called "Team Battistelli")</a>.</p>
<p>“For your information,” told us a reader, “according to the rumour mill at the EPO, <a nicetitle="The EPO’s Investigative Unit Exposed: Part IV" href="http://techrights.org/2015/11/06/investigative-unit-pd-0-6/">John Martin who is the current Principal Director of Internal Audit and Oversight at the EPO</a> is close to retirement.” It’s him who <a nicetitle="The European Patent Office Has Become Militarised" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/08/epo-and-privatised-military/">militiarised the EPO</a> (<a nicetitle="EPO Officially Confirms That It Specifically Hired Control Risks Group (CRG) to Spy on Journalists and Their Sources" href="http://techrights.org/2015/06/06/private-spying-complex/">against its very own staff</a>).</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 300px;">“Since October 2012, her direct superior and reporting officer has been the Vice-President of Directorate General 4 (VP4), Mr Željko Topić.”<br><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–Anonymous</font></span>“This is fuelling speculation as to who his successor might be,” this reader added. “Two of the names being bandied about are those of Ms Elodie Bergot and her husband Mr Gilles Requena.”</p>
<p>Bergot already sends <a nicetitle="The European Patent Office’s Autocracy Has Proven the Streisand Effect, Amplifying Its Opposition’s Messages" href="http://techrights.org/2015/09/22/epo-streisand-effect/">threatening letters to staff</a>, so she would not be a misfit here.</p>
<p>Our reader gave us some background information about this duo, starting with <a nicetitle="Management Committee" href="https://www.epo.org/about-us/office/management-committee.html">Elodie Bergot</a> (<b>warning</b>: don’t click this link if tracking by epo.org can unmask a meaningful — mappable to ID — IP address, use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919170908/http://www.epo.org/about-us/office/management-committee.html">this archive</a> instead). Ms Bergot is currently the Principal Director of Human Resources at the EPO (PD 4.3). We have learned, based on numerous sources, that staff isn’t particularly fond of her, in part because of how she reached her current position.</p>
<p>“She was recruited as an administrator at the EPO in Munich,” told us one source, indicating that this happened on the 1<sup>st</sup> of December 2010, “and started off her career at grade A3 in Department 4.3.1 (Regulations and Change Management).</p>
<p><span class="pullQuote" style="width: 200px;">“Such an extraordinary “promotion” is without precedent at the EPO.”<br><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–Anonymous</font></span>“Shortly before the completion of the normal one-year probation period foreseen for category A staff, Ms Bergot was transferred to Department 4.3 on 1 October 2011.</p>
<p>“Since October 2012, her direct superior and reporting officer has been the Vice-President of Directorate General 4 (VP4), Mr Željko Topić.” That’s the man who <a nicetitle="Special Report: Many Criminal Charges Against EPO Vice-President Željko Topić" href="http://techrights.org/2014/11/16/six-criminal-lawsuits-against-zeljko-topic/">faces criminal charges</a> and also <a nicetitle="Staff of the EPO Under Siege Ahead of Tomorrow’s Demonstration in Munich" href="http://techrights.org/2015/10/13/suppressing-demonstration-in-munich/">intimidates</a> <a nicetitle="Željko Topić Attacks EPO Staff for ‘Daring’ to Legally Challenge the EPO’s Management Over Its Gross Abuses in Europe" href="http://techrights.org/2015/10/06/more-threats-from-topic/">EPO staff</a>.</p>
<p>Here comes the interesting part. According to ours source, Bergot achieved the unthinkable. “On 30 January 2013,” we were told, “Ms Bergot was promoted to grade A6 with effect from 1 February 2013.</p>
<p>“Such an extraordinary “promotion” is without precedent at the EPO.”</p>
<p>In the next part we are going to look into complaints about this promotion. We will take a closer look into possibly reasons why such a magical promotion could be facilitated. It’s <em>not</em> purely speculative, so facts will be presented and readers will be left to reach their own conclusions. <a href="#top">█</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>LINUX IS already past the point when, in theory, Skynet should have created a T-800 Terminator to save John Connor, and Linux puppetmaster Linus Torvalds has released the first release candidate for kernel version 4.4.</p>
<p>“Just looking at the patch itself, things look fairly normal at a high level, possibly a bit more driver-heavy than usual with about 75 percent of the patch being drivers, and 10 percent being architecture updates,” said Torvalds in a release statement.</p></blockquote>

After many attempts at bringing it back into working order, I’ve settled on an approach that seems to work: now that qemu and libvirt have made virtualization and emulation easy, I can run it in a version of Windows that was current at the time of its release. Unfortunately, Windows 98 doesn’t virtualize particularly well either, so this still became a relatively extensive yak-shaving exercise.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
Of the three distributions, I think Fedora is closest to the cutting edge, with openSUSE and Ubuntu both fairly close behind. However, Fedora and Ubuntu have relatively short support cycles with Fedora releases usually supported for about 14 months, Ubuntu 15.10 for just nine months and openSUSE 42.1 will receive three years of support.</p>
<p>The best distribution for the job will depend on the person and, of course, the role the distribution is to play. I think Fedora is aimed mostly at more technical users and people who like to tinker. Ubuntu is aimed squarely at Linux newcomers who generally want to just use their computer and openSUSE appears to be aiming at a sort of middle ground: people who have a little Linux experience and want options, but also want reliability and longer support cycles. </p></blockquote>

<p>Installing Ubuntu is simple and hardware support is handled brillliantly.</p>
<p>The repositories are full of great applications and the default applications within Ubuntu whilst small in number are well thought out and fully featured.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the one let down is the Software Centre. The software is old, tired, confused, unintuitive and fails to do the one thing for which it is designed to do.</p>
<p>My advice is to install Ubuntu and then get Synaptic. After you have done that replace Totem with VLC and Firefox with Chrome.</p></blockquote>

France – our closest neighbour, oldest friend, beloved rival, what Philip Sidney called ‘that sweet enemy’ – France is stricken, and we should weep with her.</p>
<p>Over the past 40 years or so, most of us have heard quite enough politicians and others pledging to stand firm against terror, hunt down the vile perpetrators, ensure that it never happens again, and the rest.</p>
<p>Then there have been the emergency meetings of grandly titled committees, the crackdowns, the increased surveillance, the billions spent on spying and snooping, not to mention the various wars on terror which have certainly killed a lot of our troops, but never seem to make us any safer. It is remarkably hard to defend yourself against an enemy whose language few of us speak, yet who speaks ours and can move freely in our world, and who is willing, even happy, to die at our hands – or his own – if he can kill us first.</p></blockquote>

For that reason, I’m of the mind to avoid any grand claims that surveillance failed to find the perpetrators (thus far, French authorities say they know one of the attackers, who is a French guy they had IDed as an extremist, but did not know of people identified by passports found at the Stade — though predictably those have now been confirmed to be fake [update: now authorities say the Syrian one is genuine, though it’s not yet clear it belonged to the attacker], so authorities may turn out to know their real identity). In any case, Glenn Greenwald takes care of that here. I think it’s possible the terrorists did manage to avoid detection via countersurveillance — though the key ways they might have done so were available and known before Edward Snowden’s leaks (as Glenn points out).</p></blockquote>
